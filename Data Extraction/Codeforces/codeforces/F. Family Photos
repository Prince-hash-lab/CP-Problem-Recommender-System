So when some old family photos were found in the attic, they started to argue about who should receive which photos. In the end, they decided that they would take turns picking photos.

In each turn, a player may take only a photo from the top of one of the stacks.\u000aEach photo is described by two non-negative integers a and b, indicating that it is worth a units of happiness to Alice and b units of happiness to Bonnie.

The game ends when all photos are taken or both players pass consecutively.\u000aThe players don't act to maximize their own happiness. Instead, each player acts to maximize the amount by which her happiness exceeds her sister's. Assuming both players play optimal, find the difference between Alice's and Bonnie's happiness.
