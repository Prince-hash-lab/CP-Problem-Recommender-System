VB. Alyona and flowers\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aLittle Alyona is celebrating Happy Birthday! Her mother has an array of n flowers. Each flower has some mood, the mood of i-th flower is ai. The mood can be positive, zero or negative.\u000aLet's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The mother suggested some set of subarrays. Alyona wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother. After that, each of the flowers will add to the girl's happiness its mood multiplied by the number of chosen subarrays the flower is in.\u000aFor example, consider the case when the mother has 5 flowers, and their moods are equal to 1,\u2009\u2009-\u20092,\u20091,\u20093,\u2009\u2009-\u20094. Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,\u2009\u2009-\u20092), (3,\u2009\u2009-\u20094), (1,\u20093), (1,\u2009\u2009-\u20092,\u20091,\u20093). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then:\u000athe first flower adds 1·1\u2009=\u20091 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,\u000athe second flower adds (\u2009-\u20092)·1\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20092, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,\u000athe third flower adds 1·2\u2009=\u20092, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,\u000athe fourth flower adds 3·2\u2009=\u20096, because he is in two of chosen subarrays,\u000athe fifth flower adds (\u2009-\u20094)·0\u2009=\u20090, because he is in no chosen subarrays.\u000aThus, in total 1\u2009+\u2009(\u2009-\u20092)\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20096\u2009+\u20090\u2009=\u20097 is added to the girl's happiness. Alyona wants to choose such subarrays from those suggested by the mother that the value added to her happiness would be as large as possible. Help her do this!\u000aAlyona can choose any number of the subarrays, even 0 or all suggested by her mother.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains two integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the number of flowers and the number of subarrays suggested by the mother.\u000aThe second line contains the flowers moods \u2014 n integers a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an (\u2009-\u2009100\u2009\u2264\u2009ai\u2009\u2264\u2009100).\u000aThe next m lines contain the description of the subarrays suggested by the mother.
