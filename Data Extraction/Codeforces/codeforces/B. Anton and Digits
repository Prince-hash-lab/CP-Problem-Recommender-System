Anton and Digits\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aRecently Anton found a box with digits in his room. There are k2 digits 2, k3 digits 3, k5 digits 5 and k6 digits 6.\u000aAnton's favorite integers are 32 and 256. He decided to compose this integers from digits he has. He wants to make the sum of these integers as large as possible. Help him solve this task!\u000aEach digit can be used no more than once, i.e. the composed integers should contain no more than k2 digits 2, k3 digits 3 and so on. Of course, unused digits are not counted in the sum.\u000aInput\u000aThe only line of the input contains four integers k2, k3, k5 and k6 \u2014 the number of digits 2, 3, 5 and 6 respectively (0\u2009\u2264\u2009k2,\u2009k3,\u2009k5,\u2009k6\u2009\u2264\u20095·106).\u000aOutput\u000aPrint one integer \u2014 maximum possible sum of Anton's favorite integers that can be composed using digits from the box.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a5 1 3 4\u000aoutput\u000a800\u000ainput\u000a1 1 1 1\u000aoutput\u000a256\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample, there are five digits 2, one digit 3, three digits 5 and four digits 6.

Note, that there is one unused integer 2 and one unused integer 6. They are not counted in the answer.\u000aIn the second sample, the optimal answer is to create on integer 256, thus the answer is 256.
