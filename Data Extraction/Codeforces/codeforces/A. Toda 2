There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the i-th friend is ri.\u000aThe friends decided to take part in the championship as a team.

So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.\u000aOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches.
