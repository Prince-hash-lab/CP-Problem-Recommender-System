VA.

Everyone has exactly one crush, i-th person's crush is person with the number crushi.\u000aSomeday Arpa shouted Owf loudly from the top of the palace and a funny game started in Arpa's land. The rules are as follows.\u000aThe game consists of rounds. Assume person x wants to start a round, he calls crushx and says: "Oww...wwf" (the letter w is repeated t times) and cuts off the phone immediately. If t\u2009>\u20091 then crushx calls crushcrushx and says: "Oww...wwf" (the letter w is repeated t\u2009-\u20091 times) and cuts off the phone immediately. The round continues until some person receives an "Owf" (t\u2009=\u20091). This person is called the Joon-Joon of the round. There can't be two rounds at the same time.\u000aMehrdad has an evil plan to make the game more funny, he wants to find smallest t (t\u2009\u2265\u20091) such that for each person x, if x starts some round and y becomes the Joon-Joon of the round, then by starting from y, x would become the Joon-Joon of the round. Find such t for Mehrdad if it's possible.\u000aSome strange fact in Arpa's land is that someone can be himself's crush (i.e. crushi\u2009=\u2009i).\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the number of people in Arpa's land.\u000aThe second line contains n integers, i-th of them is crushi (1\u2009\u2264\u2009crushi\u2009\u2264\u2009n) \u2014 the number of i-th person's crush.\u000aOutput\u000aIf there is no t satisfying the condition, print -1. Otherwise print such smallest t.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a4\u000a2 3 1 4\u000aoutput\u000a3\u000ainput\u000a4\u000a4 4 4 4\u000aoutput\u000a-1\u000ainput\u000a4\u000a2 1 4 3\u000aoutput\u000a1\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample suppose t\u2009=\u20093.\u000aIf the first person starts some round:\u000aThe first person calls the second person and says "Owwwf", then the second person calls the third person and says "Owwf", then the third person calls the first person and says "Owf", so the first person becomes Joon-Joon of the round. So the condition is satisfied if x is 1.\u000aThe process is similar for the second and the third person.\u000aIf the fourth person starts some round:\u000aThe fourth person calls himself and says "Owwwf", then he calls himself again and says "Owwf", then he calls himself for another time and says "Owf", so the fourth person becomes Joon-Joon of the round. So the condition is satisfied when x is 4.\u000aIn the last example if the first person starts a round, then the second person becomes the Joon-Joon, and vice versa.
