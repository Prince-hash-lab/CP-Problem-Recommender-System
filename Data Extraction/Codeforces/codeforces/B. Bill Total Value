The bill is a string in which the names of the purchases and their prices are printed in a row without any spaces. Check has the format "name1price1name2price2...namenpricen", where namei (name of the i-th purchase) is a non-empty string of length not more than 10, consisting of lowercase English letters, and pricei (the price of the i-th purchase) is a non-empty string, consisting of digits and dots (decimal points). It is possible that purchases with equal names have different prices.\u000aThe price of each purchase is written in the following format. If the price is an integer number of dollars then cents are not written.\u000aOtherwise, after the number of dollars a dot (decimal point) is written followed by cents in a two-digit format (if number of cents is between 1 and 9 inclusively, there is a leading zero).\u000aAlso, every three digits (from less significant to the most) in dollars are separated by dot (decimal point).
