VD. Contest Balloons\u000atime limit per test3 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aOne tradition of ACM-ICPC contests is that a team gets a balloon for every solved problem. We assume that the submission time doesn't matter and teams are sorted only by the number of balloons they have. It means that one's place is equal to the number of teams with more balloons, increased by 1. For example, if there are seven teams with more balloons, you get the eight place. Ties are allowed.\u000aYou should know that it's important to eat before a contest. If the number of balloons of a team is greater than the weight of this team, the team starts to float in the air together with their workstation. They eventually touch the ceiling, what is strictly forbidden by the rules. The team is then disqualified and isn't considered in the standings.\u000aA contest has just finished. There are n teams, numbered 1 through n. The i-th team has ti balloons and weight wi. It's guaranteed that ti doesn't exceed wi so nobody floats initially.\u000aLimak is a member of the first team. He doesn't like cheating and he would never steal balloons from other teams. Instead, he can give his balloons away to other teams, possibly making them float. Limak can give away zero or more balloons of his team. Obviously, he can't give away more balloons than his team initially has.\u000aWhat is the best place Limak can get?\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the standard input contains one integer n (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009300\u2009000) \u2014 the number of teams.\u000aThe i-th of n following lines contains two integers ti and wi (0\u2009\u2264\u2009ti\u2009\u2264\u2009wi\u2009\u2264\u20091018) \u2014 respectively the number of balloons and the weight of the i-th team.
