VE. Gosha is hunting\u000atime limit per test5 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aGosha is hunting. His goal is to catch as many Pokemons as possible. Gosha has a Poke Balls and b Ultra Balls. There are n Pokemons. They are numbered 1 through n. Gosha knows that if he throws a Poke Ball at the i-th Pokemon he catches it with probability pi. If he throws an Ultra Ball at the i-th Pokemon he catches it with probability ui. He can throw at most one Ball of each type at any Pokemon.\u000aThe hunting proceeds as follows: at first, Gosha chooses no more than a Pokemons at which he will throw Poke Balls and no more than b Pokemons at which he will throw Ultra Balls. After that, he throws the chosen Balls at the chosen Pokemons. If he throws both Ultra Ball and Poke Ball at some Pokemon, he is caught if and only if he is caught by any of these Balls. The outcome of a throw doesn't depend on the other throws.\u000aGosha would like to know what is the expected number of the Pokemons he catches if he acts in an optimal way. In other words, he would like to know the maximum possible expected number of Pokemons can catch.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains three integers n, a and b (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u20092000, 0\u2009\u2264\u2009a,\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u2009n) \u2014 the number of Pokemons, the number of Poke Balls and the number of Ultra Balls.\u000aThe second line contains n real values p1,\u2009p2,\u2009...,\u2009pn (0\u2009\u2264\u2009pi\u2009\u2264\u20091), where pi is the probability of catching the i-th Pokemon if Gosha throws a Poke Ball to it.\u000aThe third line contains n real values u1,\u2009u2,\u2009...,\u2009un (0\u2009\u2264\u2009ui\u2009\u2264\u20091), where ui is the probability of catching the i-th Pokemon if Gosha throws an Ultra Ball to it.\u000aAll the probabilities are given with exactly three digits after the decimal separator.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint the maximum possible expected number of Pokemons Gosha can catch.
