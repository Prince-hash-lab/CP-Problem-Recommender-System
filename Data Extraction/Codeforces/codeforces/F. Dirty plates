VF. Dirty plates\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aAfter one of celebrations there is a stack of dirty plates in Nikita's kitchen. Nikita has to wash them and put into a dryer. In dryer, the plates should be also placed in a stack also, and the plates sizes should increase down up. The sizes of all plates are distinct.\u000aNikita has no so much free space, specifically, he has a place for only one more stack of plates. Therefore, he can perform only such two operations:\u000aTake any number of plates from 1 to a from the top of the dirty stack, wash them and put them to the intermediate stack.\u000aTake any number of plates from 1 to b from the top of the intermediate stack and put them to the stack in the dryer.\u000aNote that after performing each of the operations, the plates are put in the same order as they were before the operation.\u000aYou are given the sizes of the plates s1,\u2009s2,\u2009...,\u2009sn in the down up order in the dirty stack, and integers a and b. All the sizes are distinct. Write a program that determines whether or not Nikita can put the plates in increasing down up order in the dryer. If he is able to do so, the program should find some sequence of operations (not necessary optimal) to achieve it.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains three integers n, a and b (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u20092000, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009a,\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u2009n). The second line contains integers s1,\u2009s2,\u2009...,\u2009sn (1\u2009\u2264\u2009si\u2009\u2264\u2009n) \u2014 the sizes of the plates in down up order. All the sizes are distinct.\u000aOutput\u000aIn the first line print "YES" if there is a solution. In this case, in the second line print integer k \u2014 the number of operations. Then in k lines print the operations, one per line. Each operation is described by two integers tj and cj, where tj\u2009=\u20091, if the operation is to wash the top cj places from the dirty stack and put them onto the intermediate stack, and tj\u2009=\u20092, if the operation is to move th top cj plates from the intermediate stack to the dryer.\u000aIn case there is no solution, print single line "NO".\u000aIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Note that it is not necessary to minimize the number of operations.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a6 2 3\u000a2 3 6 4 1 5\u000aoutput\u000aYES\u000a8\u000a1 2\u000a1 1\u000a2 1\u000a1 2\u000a1 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 3\u000ainput\u000a7 7 7\u000a1 2 3 4 5 6 7\u000aoutput\u000aYES\u000a2\u000a1 7\u000a2 7\u000ainput\u000a7 1 1\u000a1 2 3 4 5 6 7\u000aoutput\u000aYES\u000a14\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a1 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 1\u000a2 1\u000ainput\u000a4 2 2\u000a3 2 1 4\u000aoutput\u000aNO\u000aNote\u000aIn the first example the initial order of plates was 2,\u20093,\u20096,\u20094,\u20091,\u20095. Here is how the stacks look like after each of the operations:\u000a[1 2]: Dirty stack: 6,\u20094,\u20091,\u20095. Intermediary stack: 2,\u20093. The dryer is empty.\u000a[1 1]: Dirty stack: 4,\u20091,\u20095. Intermediary stack: 6,\u20092,\u20093. The dryer is empty.\u000a[2 1]: Dirty stack: 4,\u20091,\u20095. Intermediary stack: 2,\u20093.

It is possible to wash plates one by one so that they are placed onto the intermediary stack in the reverse order, and then move plates one by one to the dryer. The final order is correct.
