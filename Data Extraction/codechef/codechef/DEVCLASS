V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aDevu is a class teacher of a class of n students. One day, in the morning prayer of the school, all the students of his class were standing in a line. You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl.\u000aDevu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc.\u000aNow by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i \u2260 j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|type.\u000aPlease help Devu in finding minimum cost of swaps needed to convert the current arrangement into a likable one.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.\u000aThe first line of each test case contains an integer type, denoting the type of the cost function. Then the next line contains string s of length n, denoting the initial arrangement s of students.\u000aNote that the integer n is not given explicitly in input.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, print a single line containing the answer of the test case, that is, the minimum cost to convert the current arrangement into a likable one. If it is not possible to convert the current arrangement into a likable one, then print -1 instead of the minimum cost.\u000aConstraints and Subtasks\u000aSubtask 1: 25 points\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 n \u2264 105\u000atype = 0\u000aSum of n over all the test cases in one test file does not exceed 106.\u000aSubtask 2: 25 points\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 n \u2264 105\u000atype = 1\u000aSum of n over all the test cases in one test file does not exceed 106.\u000aSubtask 3: 25 points\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 n \u2264 105\u000atype = 2\u000aSum of n over all the test cases in one test file does not exceed 106.\u000aSubtask 4: 25 points\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 102\u000a1 \u2264 n \u2264 103\u000atype can be 0, 1 or 2, that is type \u2208 {0, 1, 2}.\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a8\u000a0\u000aBB\u000a0\u000aBG\u000a0\u000aBBGG\u000a1\u000aBGG\u000a1\u000aBGGB\u000a1\u000aBBBGG\u000a2\u000aBBGG\u000a2\u000aBGB\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a-1\u000a0\u000a1\u000a1\u000a1\u000a3\u000a1\u000a0\u000aExplanation\u000aNote type of the first 3 test cases is 0.

aVDevu is a class teacher of a class of n students. One day, in the morning prayer of the school, all the students of his class were standing in a line. You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl.
p18
aVDevu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc.
p19
aVNow by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i \u2260 j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|type.
