V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese\u000aChef recently read about trees. He already learnt that the trees are undirected, simple, connected graphs and has no cycles. He also knows that the tree (or graph) diameter is the largest distance of two nodes in the tree (or graph). He finds out about a challenging problem: Can we decrease the diameter of the tree if we add just a single edge? Unfortunately he is tired from a lot of reading, so could you help him to solve the problem?\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test contains an integer N, denoting the number of nodes in the tree. The next N - 1 lines contain two space separated integers Ai, Bi denoting the tree edges. It's guaranteed that the input is a valid tree.\u000a  Output\u000aFor each test case, output a single line print "YES" if it is possible to add a tree an edge to decrease the diameter of the graph, otherwise print "NO".\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 30\u000a2 \u2264 N \u2264 10000\u000a1 \u2264 Ai, Bi \u2264 N\u000a  Example\u000aInput:\u000a3\u000a2\u000a1 2\u000a3 \u000a1 2\u000a2 3\u000a5\u000a1 2\u000a2 3\u000a3 4\u000a3 5\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000aNO\u000aYES\u000aYES\u000a  Explanation\u000aExample case 1.
