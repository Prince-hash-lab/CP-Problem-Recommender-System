At these parties, they play board games. This Friday, they are playing a game named "Boats! Boats! Boats!". In this game players have to transport cookies between Venice and Constantinople. Each player has a personal storage. The players are numbered from 1 to N, Chef is numbered 1. Rules for determining a winner are very difficult, therefore Chef asks you to write a program, which will determine who is a winner.\u000aThere are 6 types of cookies. For each cookie in the storage player gets 1 point.

So, his final score is 9. 10 > 9 - Chef wins. Example case 2. Example case 2 Chef has 5 + 2 (a bag with 5 different cookies) = 7. The second player has 7 + 1(a bag with 4 different cookies) = 8. 7 < 8 - the second player wins. Example case 3. Example case 3 Every player has 4 cookies and can't create any bag of sweets. So, it's a tie.
