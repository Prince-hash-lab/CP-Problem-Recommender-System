Let S denote the multi-set of numbers corresponding to the non-empty subsequences of the digits of the number n in decimal representation. Please note that the numbers in the set S can have leading zeros. Let us take an element s of the multi-set S, prod(s) denotes the product of all the digits of number s in decimal representation.\u000aThe number n will be called magical if sum of prod(s) for all elements s in S, is even.\u000aFor example, consider a number 246, its all possible non-empty subsequence will be S = {2, 4, 6, 24, 46, 26, 246}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(2) = 2, prod(4) = 4, prod(6) = 6, prod(24) = 8, prod(46) = 24, prod(26) = 12, prod(246) = 48, i.e. {2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 48}. Sum of all of these is 104, which is even. Hence 246 is a magical number.\u000aPlease note that multi-set S can contain repeated elements, e.g. if number is 55, then S = {5, 5, 55}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(5) = 5, prod(5) = 5, prod(55) = 25}, i.e. {5, 5, 25}. Sum of all of these is 35 which is odd. Hence 55 is not a\u000amagical number.\u000aConsider a number 204, then S = {2, 0, 4, 20, 04, 24, 204}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0}. Sum of all these elements will be 14 which is even. So 204 is a magical number.\u000aThe task was to simply find the Kth magical number.\u000aInput\u000aFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\u000aEach of the next T lines contains a single integer K.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the Kth magical number.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 K \u2264 1012.\u000aSubtasks\u000aSubtask #1 : (20 points)\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\u000a1 \u2264 K \u2264 104.\u000aSubtask 2 : (80 points)\u000aOriginal Constraints\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a2\u000a2\u000a5\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a2\u000a8\u000aExplanation\u000aExample case 1.\u000a2 is the 2nd magical number, since it satisfies the property of the magical number.

p18
aVA non-negative number n is said to be magical if it satisfies the following property. Let S denote the multi-set of numbers corresponding to the non-empty subsequences of the digits of the number n in decimal representation. Please note that the numbers in the set S can have leading zeros. Let us take an element s of the multi-set S, prod(s) denotes the product of all the digits of number s in decimal representation.
p19
aVThe number n will be called magical if sum of prod(s) for all elements s in S, is even.
p20
aVFor example, consider a number 246, its all possible non-empty subsequence will be S = {2, 4, 6, 24, 46, 26, 246}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(2) = 2, prod(4) = 4, prod(6) = 6, prod(24) = 8, prod(46) = 24, prod(26) = 12, prod(246) = 48, i.e. {2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 48}. Sum of all of these is 104, which is even. Hence 246 is a magical number.
p21
aVPlease note that multi-set S can contain repeated elements, e.g. if number is 55, then S = {5, 5, 55}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {prod(5) = 5, prod(5) = 5, prod(55) = 25}, i.e. {5, 5, 25}. Sum of all of these is 35 which is odd. Hence 55 is not a

aVmagical number.
p23
aVConsider a number 204, then S = {2, 0, 4, 20, 04, 24, 204}. Products of digits of these subsequences will be {2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0}. Sum of all these elements will be 14 which is even. So 204 is a magical number.
