V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aChef Po has given an online advertisement to provide Event organizing services. Chef got a huge response for his advertisement. He got various orders to conduct the events from different organizations. In turn, Chef will receive a compensation depend upon the type of event and the total numbers of persons in the event. Chef has received N orders for conducting events in this weekend in all. As weekend consists of two days all events will take place during the period of 48 hours. For the i-th order the corresponding event will start at Si hours, ends at Ei hours and Chef will receive a compensation Ci for this event. For example, if Si = 17 and Ei = 22 then duration of event is 22 \u2013 17 = 5 hours and its time period is 17:00 \u2013 22:00 of Saturday. Hours of Sunday are numbered by numbers from 24 to 48. So, for example, 10:00 of Sunday will be represented as 10 + 24 = 34. Because Chef is a newbie, the organizations had put a condition that Chef will receive a compensation for the event if and only if he is available for the entire duration of the event. It means that he can not choose overlapping events. Note, however, that if some event starts just in the moment another event has finished the Chef can safely conduct them both.\u000aIn general Chef will obey the orders on first come first serve basis. But on weekends Chef will select the orders in such a way that the total compensation for all the events he will conduct will be the maximal. Now your task is to help Chef and find this maximal total compensation.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of received orders for conducting events. Each of the next N lines contains three space separated integers Si, Ei, Ci, the parameters of the i-th event described in the problem statement.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 2000\u000a0 \u2264 Si < Ei \u2264 48\u000a0 \u2264 Ci \u2264 106\u000aOutput\u000aOutput for each test case should contain a single integer in a separate line, the maximal compensation Chef Po can get.\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a2\u000a4\u000a1 2 100\u000a2 3 200\u000a3 4 1600\u000a1 3 2100\u000a3\u000a1 10 2000\u000a2 5 100\u000a6 9 400\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a3700\u000a2000\u000aExplanation\u000aCase 1. The best choice here is to conduct 3rd and 4th events. The total compensation is equal to 1600 + 2100 = 3700. These events do not overlap since 3rd event starts just after the finish of the 4th one. Alternatively we can conduct first three events that also do not overlap. But in this case compensation will be only 100 + 200 + 1600 = 1900.\u000aCase 2. Note that first event overlaps with both second and third events, while the last two events do not overlap. Hence there are two reasonable choices available for Chef. One is to take just the first order with total compensation 2000 and the second one is to take the last two orders with total compensation 100 + 400 = 500. Clearly the first choice is better. Hence the answer is 2000.\u000aAuthor: khadarbasha\u000aTester: anton_lunyov\u000aEditorial: http://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXCOMP\u000aTags: khadarbasha oct12 simple\u000aDate Added: 31-05-2012\u000aTime Limit: 1 sec\u000aSource Limit: 50000 Bytes\u000aLanguages: ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, FS, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL, PERL6, PHP, PIKE, PRLG, PYTH, PYTH 3.4, RUBY, SCALA, SCM guile, SCM qobi, ST, TCL, TEXT, WSPC\u000aSUBMIT All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aChef Po has given an online advertisement to provide Event organizing services.
