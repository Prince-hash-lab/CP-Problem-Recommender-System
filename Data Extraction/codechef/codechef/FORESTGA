V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\u000aChef is the head of commercial logging industry that recently bought a farm containing N trees. You are given initial height of the i-th tree by Hi and the rate of growth of height as Ri meters per month. For simplicity, you can assume that all the trees are perfect cylinders of equal radius. This allows us to consider only the height of trees when we talk about the amount of wood.\u000aIn Chef's country, laws don't allow one to cut a tree partially, so one has to cut the tree completely for gathering wood. Also, laws prohibit cutting trees of heights (strictly) lower than L meters.\u000aToday Chef received an order of W meters (of height) of wood. Chef wants to deliver this order as soon as possible. Find out how minimum number of months he should wait after which he will able to fulfill the order. You can assume that Chef's company's sawing machines are very efficient and take negligible amount of time to cut the trees.\u000aInput\u000aThere is a single test case per test file.\u000aThe first line of the input contains three space separated integers N, W and L denoting the number of trees in the farm, the amount of wood (in meters) that have to be gathered and the minimum allowed height of the tree to cut.\u000aEach of next N lines contain two space separated integers denoting Hi and Ri respectively.\u000aOutput\u000aOutput a single integer denoting the number of months that have to pass before Chef will be able to fulfill the order.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 W, L \u2264 1018\u000a1 \u2264 Hi, Ri \u2264 109\u000aSubtasks\u000aSubtask #1 [40 points]: 1 \u2264 N, W, L \u2264 104\u000aSubtask #2 [60 points]: No additional constraints\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a3 74 51\u000a2 2\u000a5 7\u000a2 9\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a7\u000aExplanation\u000aAfter 6 months, heights of each tree will be 14, 47 and 56 respectively.
