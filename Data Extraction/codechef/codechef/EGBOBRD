V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aSome chefs go for a tour lasting N days. They take packages of bread for food. Each package has K pieces of breads. On the ith day, they eat Ai pieces of bread.\u000aUnfortunately, chefs are very lazy people, and they always forget to close the package of breads, so each day the last piece of bread becomes exposed to mold (a fungus), and is no longer suitable for eating. Such a bad piece is not eaten, and is instead thrown away.\u000aLet us take an example. If K = 4 and N = 3, then A = {3, 1, 2}. Chefs have packages of bread each having 4 pieces of bread, and their travel lasts 3 days. In the first day, they must eat 3 pieces of bread. So they open new package of bread and eat 3 pieces. They forget to close the package, so the 4th piece becomes bad. In the next day, they want to eat one piece of bread. And in the first package we don't have any good pieces of bread left, so they open a new package of bread and eat one piece from that. On the 3rd day, they want to eat 2 pieces of bread. In the second package, we have three pieces, and one of them is bad; so we have 2 good pieces. They eat 2 pieces from this package. So they must buy 2 packages of bread.\u000aPlease help chefs in finding out the minimum number of packages of breads they should take with them on the tour.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\u000aThe first line of each test contains two space separated integers N and K.\u000aThe next line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the number of pieces of bread the chefs want to eat each day.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each of the T test cases, output a single line - minimum number of packages of bread the chefs should take.\u000aConstraints and Subtasks\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\u000aSubtask 1: 15 points\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\u000a1 \u2264 K \u2264 100\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 100\u000aSubtask 2: 25 points\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\u000a1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^6\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^6\u000aSubtask 3: 60 points\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\u000a1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^11\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^6\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a3\u000a3 4\u000a3 1 2\u000a1 1\u000a1\u000a2 4\u000a8 8\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a2\u000a1\u000a4\u000aExplanation\u000aTest case 1 has already been explained in the statement.\u000aIn test case 2, we have one day tour and packages with one piece each.
