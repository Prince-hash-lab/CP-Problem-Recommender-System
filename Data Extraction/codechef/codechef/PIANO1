V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aRecently, Chef got obsessed with piano. He is a just a rookie in this stuff and can not move his fingers from one key to other fast enough. He discovered that the best way to train finger speed is to play scales.\u000aThere are different kinds of scales which are divided on the basis of their interval patterns. For instance, major scale is defined by pattern T-T-S-T-T-T-S, where \u2018T\u2019 stands for a whole tone whereas \u2018S\u2019 stands for a semitone. Two semitones make one tone. To understand how they are being played, please refer to the below image of piano\u2019s octave \u2013 two consecutive keys differ by one semitone.\u000aIf we start playing from first key (note C), then we\u2019ll play all white keys in a row (notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C \u2013 as you can see C and D differ for a tone as in pattern, and E and F differ for a semitone).\u000aThis pattern could be played some number of times (in cycle).\u000aEach time Chef takes some type of a scale and plays using some number of octaves. Sometimes Chef can make up some scales, so please don\u2019t blame him if you find some scale that does not exist in real world.\u000aFormally, you have a set of 12 keys (i.e. one octave) and you have N such sets in a row.

You also have a pattern that consists of letters 'T' and 'S', where 'T' means move forward for two keys (from key x to key x + 2, and 'S' means move forward for one key (from key x to key x + 1).\u000aNow, you can start playing from any of the 12*N keys. In one play, you can repeat the pattern as many times as you want, but you cannot go outside the keyboard.\u000aRepeating pattern means that if, for example, you have pattern STTST, you can play STTST as well as STTSTSTTST, as well as STTSTSTTSTSTTST, as well as any number of repeating. For this pattern, if you choose to repeat it once, if you start at some key x, you'll press keys: x (letter 'S')-> x + 1 (letter 'T')-> x + 3 (letter 'T')-> x + 5 (letter 'S') -> x + 6 (letter 'T')-> x + 8.

aVRecently, Chef got obsessed with piano. He is a just a rookie in this stuff and can not move his fingers from one key to other fast enough. He discovered that the best way to train finger speed is to play scales.
p18
aVThere are different kinds of scales which are divided on the basis of their interval patterns. For instance, major scale is defined by pattern T-T-S-T-T-T-S, where \u2018T\u2019 stands for a whole tone whereas \u2018S\u2019 stands for a semitone. Two semitones make one tone. To understand how they are being played, please refer to the below image of piano\u2019s octave \u2013 two consecutive keys differ by one semitone.
p19
aVIf we start playing from first key (note C), then we\u2019ll play all white keys in a row (notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C \u2013 as you can see C and D differ for a tone as in pattern, and E and F differ for a semitone).

aVEach time Chef takes some type of a scale and plays using some number of octaves. Sometimes Chef can make up some scales, so please don\u2019t blame him if you find some scale that does not exist in real world.
p22
aVFormally, you have a set of 12 keys (i.e. one octave) and you have N such sets in a row. So in total, you have 12*N keys. You also have a pattern that consists of letters 'T' and 'S', where 'T' means move forward for two keys (from key x to key x + 2, and 'S' means move forward for one key (from key x to key x + 1).
p23
aVNow, you can start playing from any of the 12*N keys. In one play, you can repeat the pattern as many times as you want, but you cannot go outside the keyboard.
p24
aVRepeating pattern means that if, for example, you have pattern STTST, you can play STTST as well as STTSTSTTST, as well as STTSTSTTSTSTTST, as well as any number of repeating. For this pattern, if you choose to repeat it once, if you start at some key x, you'll press keys: x (letter 'S')-> x + 1 (letter 'T')-> x + 3 (letter 'T')-> x + 5 (letter 'S') -> x + 6 (letter 'T')-> x + 8.
