V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aSamosa Bhai got tired of the difficult tasks given by CodeChef along with meagre salary being paid to him. So he moves to Aloo uncle's village and opens a courier company there. In the village, everyone knows Aloo uncle and Kachori Aunty, so everyone sends their gifts using Samosa Bhai's courier company only.\u000aThere are N houses in a row in the village. On New Year's Eve, each house sends a gift to all the other houses.\u000aThe distance between two houses situated at positions x and y in the row is |x - y|. Samosa Bhai's courier company charges dk rupees for each delivery, where d is the distance between the 2 houses.\u000aEveryone chose Samosa Bhai's company because of Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty. So he decides to give them the amount of money earned by him modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). You need to compute this amount.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\u000aThe first line of each test case contains 2 integers \u2014 N and k \u2014 denoting the number of houses and the exponent k, resepctively. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, \u2026 , AN denoting the positions of the houses.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, output a single line with the amount given to Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty by Samosa Bhai.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 104\u000a2 \u2264 N \u2264 105\u000a0 \u2264 k \u2264 100\u000a0 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1000000006\u000aThe sum of N over all test cases will be at most 100000\u000a2 houses can be at the same position\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a5\u000a2 2\u000a7 2\u000a2 3\u000a7 2\u000a3 2\u000a1 3 2\u000a10 2\u000a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\u000a10 10\u000a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a50\u000a250\u000a12\u000a1650\u000a558199159\u000aExplanation\u000aExample case 1.
