He has recently asked his friend about the time, and instead of the straightforward answer, his friend, being an absolute jerk, told him the absolute value of angle between hour and minute hands.\u000aBut that is obviously not what he wanted to know, so he asks you to help him, by writing down all valid values of time (in hours and minutes, both non-negative integers) from midnight (inclusive) to noon (not inclusive) which satisfy the information Chef's friend has provided. Keep in mind that a time value is considered valid if the angle between the clock's hands for that value and the angle Chef's friend has described differ by less than 1/120 degrees.\u000aNote that the movement of the minute hand influences the hour hand.
