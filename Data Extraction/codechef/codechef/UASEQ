V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aYou are given an array that consists of n integer numbers. You have to change at most K elements of this array, so that the resulting array will be a arithmetic progression. From all the possible arithmetic progressions, you should choose most beautiful.\u000aYou can uniquely define the arithmetic progression by two numbers a0 and d - the first element of the given progression and the step that defines next element. (ai = a0+i * d). The progression A(a0 , d0) is more beautiful than the progression B(b0, d1) iff (a0 < b0 or (a0 = b0 and d0 < d1))\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains two integers N and K denoting the number of elements in the given array and the number of elements that you can change\u000aThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the given array.\u000aOutput\u000aOutput a single line containing the resulting array with at most K changes.
