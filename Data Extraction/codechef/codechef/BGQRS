V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\u000aWARNING: This problem has large input / output files. Use of faster I/O methods is recommended.\u000aYou are given an array A consisting of N integers. You have to answer M queries on it. Each query belongs to one of the following three types:\u000a1 L R X : multiply each number in the range AL, AL + 1, ..., AR by X.\u000a2 L R Y : Replace the elements AL, AL + 1, ..., AR by Y, 2 * Y, ... (R - L + 1) * Y. In other words, the number Ai will be equal to (i - L + 1) * Y for each i from L to R.\u000a3 L R : Find the product of all numbers in the range AL, AL + 1, ..., AR. As this number could be very large, you have to just find the number of trailing zeros of this number when represented in decimal notation.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.\u000aThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\u000aThe second line contains N space-separated integers denoting A1, A2, ..., AN\u000aFor next M lines, each line contains a query.\u000aEach query is given by three or four (please refer to the statement) space separated integers.\u000aThe first integer denotes type of the query. For every type of query next two integers denote L and R. For each query of type 1, next integer denote X.
