He has a lot of rare and unusual ones in his collection. Unfortunately, a few days ago he was fired from his well-paid job.\u000aBut he doesn't complain about that, he acts! That's why Mike picked up N stamps from his collection and is going to sell them. He has already placed an announcement on the Internet and got M offers. Each offer can be described as a set of stamps, that the buyer wants to buy. Now Mike needs your help to choose a set of offers, that he should accept.\u000aHe can't accept offers partially.
