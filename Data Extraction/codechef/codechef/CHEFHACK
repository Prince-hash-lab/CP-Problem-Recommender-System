It may be The End of the Universe!!!\u000aAliens had stolen the important data about the Birth of the Human beings and they kept this data in their secured Data Center. With the help of these data along with the advanced technologies Aliens had initiated a project called It's The End to get rid of the human beings and occupy the Earth.\u000aOn the other side, Chef Po is a good and very well-known Hacker. He is a great human lover, so he decided to get the data back from the Aliens by hacking their Data Center.\u000aThe Aliens Data Center contains various servers arranged in N rows and N columns and the Master Server will be at the last row and the last column of the Data Center. Denote the server at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of the Data Center as Server[i][j] (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N). So in this notation Master Server is Server[N][N]. Two servers are connected to each other if they are located either at the same row and consecutive columns or at the same column and consecutive rows. In other words, Server[i][j] and Server[i-1][j] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 2 \u2264 i \u2264 N and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N. Also Server[i][j] and Server[i][j-1] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and 2 \u2264 j \u2264 N.\u000aAliens had divided the Data File with the data about the Birth of the Human beings into N * N parts denoted as F[i][j] (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N) and placed the part F[i][j] at the Server[i][j]. Each server has a password which is some non-negative integer. Chef Po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the Data File.\u000aAliens are really strange beings so they single out three types of passwords:\u000aPrime Password, which is the prime number. The list of prime numbers starts as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...\u000aEven Password, which is the even non-prime number. This list starts as 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ... Note, that we exclude 2 since it is a prime.\u000aOdd Password, which is the odd non-prime number. This list starts as 1, 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, ... So it is the list of all odd positive numbers where primes are excluded.\u000aFor simplicity we call server secured by the Even Password as Even Server. Similarly we define notion of Odd Server and Prime Server.\u000aEach Odd or Even server has a friendly screen with the color indicator. Assume that you enter the password trying to guess the actual password at this server. Then indicator will become green if you enter the number which is smaller than the actual password, it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct.\u000aOn the other hand, each Prime Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all prime numbers until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of primes in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password.\u000aProbably most of you think that to crack servers with friendly screen Chef Po will use binary search. But he is quite weird Hacker and doesn't know this concept. To crack server with the friendly screen he will use the following strategy. He will try all even numbers starting from 0 (even number 2) until he either finds the correct password or the indicator becomes red which automatically would mean that the password is odd and equals to the K-1 where K is the even number that was entered at last. So he enters K-1 in the latter case and get the access to the server.\u000aLet's consider some examples.\u000aLet the password be 4. It is an Even Password so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even or Odd. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries.\u000aLet the password be 9. It is an Odd Password so again Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even Server or Odd Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries. Note that after he enters 8 the indicator becomes green indicating that the password is greater than 8, on the other hand, after he enters 10 the indicator becomes red indicating that the password is less than 10. Since the only integer number greater than 8 and less than 10 is 9 he will enter it at the last step getting the access to the server.\u000aFinally, let the password be 11. It is a Prime Password so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is Prime Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 making 4 unsuccessful tries.\u000aThe Alien Data Center has very interesting vulnerability, that Chef has noticed by analyzing Alien's secured correspondence. If Chef crack some Even Server S then all Even Servers connected to S become cracked as well, and all Even Servers connected to these servers also become cracked and so on. More formally, the Even Server S' becomes cracked if it is connected with S via possibly other Even Servers. That is, there exists a sequence of Even Servers such that each two consecutive servers in this sequence are connected, the first server is S and the last server is S'. Chef calls this vulnerability as "Grid Hacking Mechanism". The same is true for Odd Servers. By it is no longer true for Prime Servers. So each Prime Server should be cracked individually.\u000aNow the final tactic for Chef is the following.\u000aHe will consider the servers in row-major order.\u000aThat is, at first he consider servers of the first row in the order Server[1][1], Server[1][2], ..., Server[1][N]. Then he considers servers of the second row in the order Server[2][1], Server[2][2], ..., Server[2][N] and so on until he reaches the last server in the last row (which is the Master Server).\u000aFor each server he at first check whether it is already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aIf yes then he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and move on.\u000aOtherwise he checks for the friendly screen at this server and apply one of the cracking tactics described above.\u000aThat is, when he sees the friendly screen he will enter even numbers starting from zero until he finds the password in the way described above. After that he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and also some other servers become cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aAnd when he doesn't see the screen he will enter prime numbers in increasing order until he finds the password. After that he again gathers the corresponding part of the Data File but no other servers become cracked since "Grid Hacking Mechanism" does not work for Prime Servers.\u000aFinally he will reach the Master Server, crack it and gather the last part of the Data File.\u000aBut the only way to recombine the original file is to use special Alien utility called winripzar on the Master Server. It also has the password. Chef Po is a great hacker, so he found out using his special skills that the password for winripzar equals to the number of unsuccessful tries used by him to crack all the servers in the Data Center.\u000aAfter cracking all the servers and gathering all the parts of the Data File Chef became so happy that forgot the number of unsuccessful tries he made during this cracking marathon. But he noted down passwords for all the servers and now asks you for help. Calculate the number of unsuccessful tries Chef did during cracking of all the servers and let him save the Earth!\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. Each of the following N lines contains N space separated integers. The j-th number at the i-th line denotes the password at the Server[i][j].\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of unsuccessful tries used to crack all the servers in the Data Center.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 8\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 350\u000a0 \u2264 each password < 107\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a2\u000a3\u000a2 6 4\u000a4 8 9\u000a7 9 4\u000a2\u000a8 4\u000a15 4\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a20\u000a13\u000aExplanation\u000aExample case 1.\u000aThe type of each server can be found in the following table.\u000aPrime Even Even\u000aEven Even Odd\u000aPrime Odd Even\u000aNow the process of cracking of servers by the Chef will be the following.\u000aAt first Chef cracks the Server[1][1] secured by the password 2 which is a prime number. Hence Chef does not see the friendly screen and tries prime numbers in increasing order. Since 2 is the smallest prime number he cracks this server without unsuccessful tries. Since it is a Prime Server than "Grid Hacking Mechanism" does not work here.\u000aNext Chef cracks the Server[1][2] secured by the password 6 which is an Even Password (even non-prime number). Hence Chef sees the friendly screen and tries even numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6 making 3 unsuccessful tries to crack this server. Since it is an Even Server than by "Grid Hacking Mechanism" the following 3 servers also become cracked: Server[1][3], Server[2][1] and Server[2][2] since they all Even Servers and connected to the Server[1][2] via other Even Servers (see the above table). Note, that Even Server[3][3] does not become cracked since it is not connected to Server[1][2] via other Even Servers.\u000aNext Chef consider the Server[1][3]. As was mentioned above it was already cracked so Chef simply gatheres the corresponding part of the Data File without entering any numbers.\u000aThe same is true for the next two servers Server[2][1] and Server[2][2].\u000aBut Server[2][3] is secured by the odd non-prime number 9 so it is an Odd Server and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries to crack it. Applying "Grid Hacking Mechanism" for this server has no effect since it is not connected to any other Odd Server.\u000aThe Server[3][1] is Prime and Chef tries numbers in order 2, 3, 5, 7 making 3 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[3][2] is Odd and was not cracked earlier. Hence Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[3][3] is Even and was not cracked earlier. Hence Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aSummarizing we see that Chef made 20 unsuccessful tries in all. Their distribution among servers can be found in the following table.\u000a0 3 0\u000a0 0 6\u000a3 6 2\u000aExample case 2.\u000aThe type of each server can be found in the following table.\u000aEven Even\u000aOdd Even\u000aNow the process of cracking of servers by the Chef will be the following.\u000aThe Server[1][1] is Even and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 making 4 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[1][2] is Even and already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aThe Server[2][1] is Odd and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 15 making 9 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[2][2] is Even and already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aThus, Chefs made 13 unsuccessful tries and their distribution among servers can be found in the following table.\u000a4 0\u000a9 0\u000aWarning!\u000aThe input file size could reach almost 8MB so be sure you are using fast I/O method.\u000aAuthor: khadarbasha\u000aTester: anton_lunyov\u000aEditorial: http://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFHACK\u000aTags: dfs easy jan13 khadarbasha sieve\u000aDate Added: 31-10-2012\u000aTime Limit: 2 sec\u000aSource Limit: 50000 Bytes\u000aLanguages: ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, FS, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL, PERL6, PHP, PIKE, PRLG, PYTH, PYTH 3.4, RUBY, SCALA, SCM guile, SCM qobi, ST, TCL, TEXT, WSPC\u000aSUBMIT All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aImportant!!!

So it is the list of all odd positive numbers where primes are excluded. Prime Password, which is the prime number. The list of prime numbers starts as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...

This list starts as 1, 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, ... So it is the list of all odd positive numbers where primes are excluded. Odd Password 1, 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, ... For simplicity we call server secured by the Even Password as Even Server. Similarly we define notion of Odd Server and Prime Server. Each Odd or Even server has a friendly screen with the color indicator. Assume that you enter the password trying to guess the actual password at this server. Then indicator will become green if you enter the number which is smaller than the actual password, it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct. On the other hand, each Prime Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all prime numbers until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of primes in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password. Probably most of you think that to crack servers with friendly screen Chef Po will use binary search. But he is quite weird Hacker and doesn't know this concept. To crack server with the friendly screen he will use the following strategy. He will try all even numbers starting from 0 (even number 2) until he either finds the correct password or the indicator becomes red which automatically would mean that the password is odd and equals to the K-1 where K is the even number that was entered at last. So he enters K-1 in the latter case and get the access to the server. K-1 K K-1 Let's consider some examples. Let the password be 4. It is an Even Password so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even or Odd. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries.\u000aLet the password be 9. It is an Odd Password so again Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even Server or Odd Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries. Note that after he enters 8 the indicator becomes green indicating that the password is greater than 8, on the other hand, after he enters 10 the indicator becomes red indicating that the password is less than 10. Since the only integer number greater than 8 and less than 10 is 9 he will enter it at the last step getting the access to the server.\u000aFinally, let the password be 11. It is a Prime Password so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is Prime Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 making 4 unsuccessful tries. Let the password be 4. It is an Even Password so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even or Odd. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries. 4 0, 2, 4 Let the password be 9. It is an Odd Password so again Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even Server or Odd Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries. Note that after he enters 8 the indicator becomes green indicating that the password is greater than 8, on the other hand, after he enters 10 the indicator becomes red indicating that the password is less than 10. Since the only integer number greater than 8 and less than 10 is 9 he will enter it at the last step getting the access to the server. 9 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 8 8 10 10 8 10 9 Finally, let the password be 11. It is a Prime Password so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is Prime Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 making 4 unsuccessful tries. 11 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 The Alien Data Center has very interesting vulnerability, that Chef has noticed by analyzing Alien's secured correspondence. If Chef crack some Even Server S then all Even Servers connected to S become cracked as well, and all Even Servers connected to these servers also become cracked and so on. More formally, the Even Server S' becomes cracked if it is connected with S via possibly other Even Servers. That is, there exists a sequence of Even Servers such that each two consecutive servers in this sequence are connected, the first server is S and the last server is S'. Chef calls this vulnerability as "Grid Hacking Mechanism". The same is true for Odd Servers. By it is no longer true for Prime Servers. So each Prime Server should be cracked individually. S S S' S S S' "Grid Hacking Mechanism" Now the final tactic for Chef is the following. He will consider the servers in row-major order.\u000aThat is, at first he consider servers of the first row in the order Server[1][1], Server[1][2], ..., Server[1][N]. Then he considers servers of the second row in the order Server[2][1], Server[2][2], ..., Server[2][N] and so on until he reaches the last server in the last row (which is the Master Server).\u000aFor each server he at first check whether it is already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aIf yes then he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and move on.\u000aOtherwise he checks for the friendly screen at this server and apply one of the cracking tactics described above.\u000aThat is, when he sees the friendly screen he will enter even numbers starting from zero until he finds the password in the way described above. After that he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and also some other servers become cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aAnd when he doesn't see the screen he will enter prime numbers in increasing order until he finds the password. After that he again gathers the corresponding part of the Data File but no other servers become cracked since "Grid Hacking Mechanism" does not work for Prime Servers.\u000aFinally he will reach the Master Server, crack it and gather the last part of the Data File. He will consider the servers in row-major order. That is, at first he consider servers of the first row in the order Server[1][1], Server[1][2], ..., Server[1][N]. Then he considers servers of the second row in the order Server[2][1], Server[2][2], ..., Server[2][N] and so on until he reaches the last server in the last row (which is the Master Server). Server[1][1] Server[1][2] Server[1][N] Server[2][1] Server[2][2] Server[2][N] For each server he at first check whether it is already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism". "Grid Hacking Mechanism" If yes then he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and move on. Otherwise he checks for the friendly screen at this server and apply one of the cracking tactics described above. That is, when he sees the friendly screen he will enter even numbers starting from zero until he finds the password in the way described above. After that he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and also some other servers become cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism". "Grid Hacking Mechanism" And when he doesn't see the screen he will enter prime numbers in increasing order until he finds the password. After that he again gathers the corresponding part of the Data File but no other servers become cracked since "Grid Hacking Mechanism" does not work for Prime Servers. "Grid Hacking Mechanism" Finally he will reach the Master Server, crack it and gather the last part of the Data File. But the only way to recombine the original file is to use special Alien utility called winripzar on the Master Server. It also has the password. Chef Po is a great hacker, so he found out using his special skills that the password for winripzar equals to the number of unsuccessful tries used by him to crack all the servers in the Data Center. winripzar winripzar After cracking all the servers and gathering all the parts of the Data File Chef became so happy that forgot the number of unsuccessful tries he made during this cracking marathon. But he noted down passwords for all the servers and now asks you for help. Calculate the number of unsuccessful tries Chef did during cracking of all the servers and let him save the Earth!

Prime Even Even\u000aEven Even Odd\u000aPrime Odd Even Prime Even Even\u000aEven Even Odd\u000aPrime Odd Even Prime Even Even Prime Even Even Even Even Odd Even Even Odd Prime Odd Even Prime Odd Even  Now the process of cracking of servers by the Chef will be the following. At first Chef cracks the Server[1][1] secured by the password 2 which is a prime number. Hence Chef does not see the friendly screen and tries prime numbers in increasing order. Since 2 is the smallest prime number he cracks this server without unsuccessful tries. Since it is a Prime Server than "Grid Hacking Mechanism" does not work here.\u000aNext Chef cracks the Server[1][2] secured by the password 6 which is an Even Password (even non-prime number). Hence Chef sees the friendly screen and tries even numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6 making 3 unsuccessful tries to crack this server. Since it is an Even Server than by "Grid Hacking Mechanism" the following 3 servers also become cracked: Server[1][3], Server[2][1] and Server[2][2] since they all Even Servers and connected to the Server[1][2] via other Even Servers (see the above table). Note, that Even Server[3][3] does not become cracked since it is not connected to Server[1][2] via other Even Servers.\u000aNext Chef consider the Server[1][3]. As was mentioned above it was already cracked so Chef simply gatheres the corresponding part of the Data File without entering any numbers.\u000aThe same is true for the next two servers Server[2][1] and Server[2][2].\u000aBut Server[2][3] is secured by the odd non-prime number 9 so it is an Odd Server and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries to crack it. Applying "Grid Hacking Mechanism" for this server has no effect since it is not connected to any other Odd Server.\u000aThe Server[3][1] is Prime and Chef tries numbers in order 2, 3, 5, 7 making 3 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[3][2] is Odd and was not cracked earlier. Hence Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[3][3] is Even and was not cracked earlier. Hence Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries to crack it. At first Chef cracks the Server[1][1] secured by the password 2 which is a prime number. Hence Chef does not see the friendly screen and tries prime numbers in increasing order. Since 2 is the smallest prime number he cracks this server without unsuccessful tries. Since it is a Prime Server than "Grid Hacking Mechanism" does not work here. Server[1][1] 2 2 "Grid Hacking Mechanism" Next Chef cracks the Server[1][2] secured by the password 6 which is an Even Password (even non-prime number). Hence Chef sees the friendly screen and tries even numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6 making 3 unsuccessful tries to crack this server. Since it is an Even Server than by "Grid Hacking Mechanism" the following 3 servers also become cracked: Server[1][3], Server[2][1] and Server[2][2] since they all Even Servers and connected to the Server[1][2] via other Even Servers (see the above table). Note, that Even Server[3][3] does not become cracked since it is not connected to Server[1][2] via other Even Servers. Server[1][2] 6 0, 2, 4, 6 "Grid Hacking Mechanism" Server[1][3] Server[2][1] Server[2][2] Server[1][2] Server[3][3] Server[1][2] Next Chef consider the Server[1][3]. As was mentioned above it was already cracked so Chef simply gatheres the corresponding part of the Data File without entering any numbers. Server[1][3] The same is true for the next two servers Server[2][1] and Server[2][2]. Server[2][1] Server[2][2] But Server[2][3] is secured by the odd non-prime number 9 so it is an Odd Server and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries to crack it. Applying "Grid Hacking Mechanism" for this server has no effect since it is not connected to any other Odd Server. Server[2][3] 9 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 "Grid Hacking Mechanism" The Server[3][1] is Prime and Chef tries numbers in order 2, 3, 5, 7 making 3 unsuccessful tries to crack it. Server[3][1] 2, 3, 5, 7 The Server[3][2] is Odd and was not cracked earlier. Hence Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries to crack it. Server[3][2] 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 The Server[3][3] is Even and was not cracked earlier. Hence Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries to crack it. Server[3][3] 0, 2, 4 Summarizing we see that Chef made 20 unsuccessful tries in all. Their distribution among servers can be found in the following table.  0 3 0\u000a0 0 6\u000a3 6 2 0 3 0\u000a0 0 6\u000a3 6 2 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 3 6 2 3 6 2  Example case 2. Example case 2. The type of each server can be found in the following table.  Even Even\u000aOdd Even Even Even\u000aOdd Even Even Even Even Even Odd Even Odd Even  Now the process of cracking of servers by the Chef will be the following. The Server[1][1] is Even and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 making 4 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[1][2] is Even and already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aThe Server[2][1] is Odd and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 15 making 9 unsuccessful tries to crack it.\u000aThe Server[2][2] is Even and already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".\u000aThus, Chefs made 13 unsuccessful tries and their distribution among servers can be found in the following table. The Server[1][1] is Even and Chef tries numbers in order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 making 4 unsuccessful tries to crack it. Server[1][1] 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 The Server[1][2] is Even and already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".

aVImportant!!! Human's are in Danger... It may be The End of the Universe!!!
p17
aVAliens had stolen the important data about the Birth of the Human beings and they kept this data in their secured Data Center. With the help of these data along with the advanced technologies Aliens had initiated a project called It's The End to get rid of the human beings and occupy the Earth.
p18
aVOn the other side, Chef Po is a good and very well-known Hacker. He is a great human lover, so he decided to get the data back from the Aliens by hacking their Data Center.
p19
aVThe Aliens Data Center contains various servers arranged in N rows and N columns and the Master Server will be at the last row and the last column of the Data Center. Denote the server at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of the Data Center as Server[i][j] (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N). So in this notation Master Server is Server[N][N]. Two servers are connected to each other if they are located either at the same row and consecutive columns or at the same column and consecutive rows. In other words, Server[i][j] and Server[i-1][j] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 2 \u2264 i \u2264 N and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N. Also Server[i][j] and Server[i][j-1] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and 2 \u2264 j \u2264 N.
p20
aVAliens had divided the Data File with the data about the Birth of the Human beings into N * N parts denoted as F[i][j] (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N) and placed the part F[i][j] at the Server[i][j]. Each server has a password which is some non-negative integer. Chef Po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the Data File.
p21
aVAliens are really strange beings so they single out three types of passwords:
p22
aVPrime Password, which is the prime number. The list of prime numbers starts as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...
p23
aVEven Password, which is the even non-prime number. This list starts as 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ... Note, that we exclude 2 since it is a prime.
p24
aVOdd Password, which is the odd non-prime number. This list starts as 1, 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, ... So it is the list of all odd positive numbers where primes are excluded.
p25
aVFor simplicity we call server secured by the Even Password as Even Server. Similarly we define notion of Odd Server and Prime Server.
p26
aVEach Odd or Even server has a friendly screen with the color indicator. Assume that you enter the password trying to guess the actual password at this server. Then indicator will become green if you enter the number which is smaller than the actual password, it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct.
p27
aVOn the other hand, each Prime Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all prime numbers until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of primes in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password.
p28
aVProbably most of you think that to crack servers with friendly screen Chef Po will use binary search. But he is quite weird Hacker and doesn't know this concept. To crack server with the friendly screen he will use the following strategy. He will try all even numbers starting from 0 (even number 2) until he either finds the correct password or the indicator becomes red which automatically would mean that the password is odd and equals to the K-1 where K is the even number that was entered at last. So he enters K-1 in the latter case and get the access to the server.
p29
aVLet's consider some examples.
p30
aVLet the password be 4. It is an Even Password so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even or Odd. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries.
p31
aVLet the password be 9. It is an Odd Password so again Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even Server or Odd Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries. Note that after he enters 8 the indicator becomes green indicating that the password is greater than 8, on the other hand, after he enters 10 the indicator becomes red indicating that the password is less than 10. Since the only integer number greater than 8 and less than 10 is 9 he will enter it at the last step getting the access to the server.
p32
aVFinally, let the password be 11. It is a Prime Password so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is Prime Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 making 4 unsuccessful tries.
p33
aVThe Alien Data Center has very interesting vulnerability, that Chef has noticed by analyzing Alien's secured correspondence. If Chef crack some Even Server S then all Even Servers connected to S become cracked as well, and all Even Servers connected to these servers also become cracked and so on. More formally, the Even Server S' becomes cracked if it is connected with S via possibly other Even Servers. That is, there exists a sequence of Even Servers such that each two consecutive servers in this sequence are connected, the first server is S and the last server is S'. Chef calls this vulnerability as "Grid Hacking Mechanism". The same is true for Odd Servers. By it is no longer true for Prime Servers. So each Prime Server should be cracked individually.
p34
aVNow the final tactic for Chef is the following.
p35
aVHe will consider the servers in row-major order.
p36
aVThat is, at first he consider servers of the first row in the order Server[1][1], Server[1][2], ..., Server[1][N]. Then he considers servers of the second row in the order Server[2][1], Server[2][2], ..., Server[2][N] and so on until he reaches the last server in the last row (which is the Master Server).
p37
aVFor each server he at first check whether it is already cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".
p38
aVIf yes then he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and move on.
p39
aVOtherwise he checks for the friendly screen at this server and apply one of the cracking tactics described above.
p40
aVThat is, when he sees the friendly screen he will enter even numbers starting from zero until he finds the password in the way described above. After that he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and also some other servers become cracked by the "Grid Hacking Mechanism".
p41
aVAnd when he doesn't see the screen he will enter prime numbers in increasing order until he finds the password. After that he again gathers the corresponding part of the Data File but no other servers become cracked since "Grid Hacking Mechanism" does not work for Prime Servers.
p42
aVFinally he will reach the Master Server, crack it and gather the last part of the Data File.
p43
aVBut the only way to recombine the original file is to use special Alien utility called winripzar on the Master Server. It also has the password. Chef Po is a great hacker, so he found out using his special skills that the password for winripzar equals to the number of unsuccessful tries used by him to crack all the servers in the Data Center.
p44
aVAfter cracking all the servers and gathering all the parts of the Data File Chef became so happy that forgot the number of unsuccessful tries he made during this cracking marathon. But he noted down passwords for all the servers and now asks you for help. Calculate the number of unsuccessful tries Chef did during cracking of all the servers and let him save the Earth!
