V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\u000aLumpy is a bus driver. Today, the conductor is absent so Lumpy has to do the conductor's job as well. There are N creatures in the bus. Sometimes the creatures don't carry change and can't pay the exact amount of the fare. Each creature in the bus today has paid an amount greater than his/her fare. You are given information about the extra amount paid by each creature, by an array A of size N, where Ai denotes the extra amount paid by the i-th creature, in rupees.\u000aAfter the end of the trip, Lumpy noticed that he had P one rupee coins and Q two rupee coins. He wants to pay back the creatures using this money. Being a kind hearted moose, Lumpy wants to pay back as many creatures as he can. Note that Lumpy will not pay back the i-th creature if he can't pay the exact amount that the i-th creature requires with the coins that he possesses.\u000aLumpy is busy driving the bus and doesn't want to calculate the maximum number of creatures he can satisfy - He will surely cause an accident if he tries to do so. Can you help him out with this task?\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\u000aFor each test case, first line consists of three space separated integers N, P and Q.\u000aSecond line consists of N space separated integers A containing N space integers, where i-th integer denotes Ai.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to maximum number of creatures that Lumpy can pay back.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 T \u2264 106\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 109\u000a0 \u2264 P, Q \u2264 1014\u000aSum of N over all the cases does not exceed 106\u000aSubtasks\u000aSubtask #1 (15 points)\u000aP = 0\u000aSubtask #2 (15 points)\u000aQ = 0\u000aSubtask #3 (70 points)\u000aOriginal constraints\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a3\u000a3 3 0\u000a1 2 2\u000a3 2 1\u000a1 2 1\u000a4 5 4\u000a2 3 4 5\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a2\u000a3\u000a3\u000aExplanation\u000aIn Test 1, Lumpy has just 3 one rupee coins.\u000aHe can pay creatures numbered {1, 2} or creatures numbered {1, 3} with these coins.
