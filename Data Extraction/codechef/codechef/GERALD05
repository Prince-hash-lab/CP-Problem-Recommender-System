He tries to group objects by their rang (a positive integer associated with each object). He also gives the formula for calculating the number of different objects with rang N as following:\u000athe number of different objects with rang N = F(N) = A0 + A1 * N + A2 * N2 + A3 * N3.\u000aNow Chef wants to know how many different multisets of these objects exist such that sum of rangs of the objects in the multiset equals to S. You are given the coefficients in F(N) and the target sum S. Please, find the number of different multisets modulo 1,000,000,007.\u000aYou should consider a multiset as an unordered sequence of integers.

p20
aVthe number of different objects with rang N = F(N) = A0 + A1 * N + A2 * N2 + A3 * N3.
p21
aVNow Chef wants to know how many different multisets of these objects exist such that sum of rangs of the objects in the multiset equals to S. You are given the coefficients in F(N) and the target sum S. Please, find the number of different multisets modulo 1,000,000,007.
