In the game, you have to face against a number army consisting of N distinct integers A1, A2, , , AN. In one move, you can shoot one magic bullet aiming at an alive enemy number, say X. The magic bullet will kill X and it will also kill X + 1 and X - 1 if they are alive when the bullet is shot. Game ends when the entire number army is killed.\u000aPrincess Rupsa wants to find out the minimum and maximum number of moves that can be played in the game.
