V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aA number is called as a lucky number if its decimal representation contains only the lucky digits, 4 and 7. e.g. 47, 744, 4 are lucky numbers, whereas 5, 17, 467 are not.\u000aRecently, Na2a found a magic stone. With the help of this stone, he can multiply a number by any lucky number. Also, the magic stone can be used any number of times (possibly zero or infinite number of times).\u000aFor example, if initially he has the number 1, then he can get numbers like 28 (formed by 1*4*7), 14476 (formed as 1*47*77*4) etc.\u000aNa2a has N numbers in his bag which are denoted by array A. For each number Ai in his bag, he asks you to transform it to a number with maximum possible number of trailing zeroes by using Magic Stone. You have to find the smallest of such numbers, since there can be multiple numbers with the maximum possible number of trailing zeros.\u000aInput\u000aThere is a single test case.\u000aFirst line contains a single integer N as stated in the problem.\u000aThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ... , AN where Ai denotes the ith number in the bag.\u000aOutput\u000aOutput N lines, in which ith line contains the answer corresponding to the number Ai.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 109\u000aSubtasks\u000aSubtask 1(8 points)\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 10\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10\u000a\u000aSubtask 2(22 points)\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 102\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 103\u000a\u000aSubtask 3(70 points)\u000aOriginal constraints\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a2\u000a2 15\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a2\u000a60\u000aExplanation\u000aExample case 1.
