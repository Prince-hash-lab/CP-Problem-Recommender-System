They have seen a lot: prosperity and hunger, tranquility and rebellions, live and death. But nevertheless, they still hold the throne.\u000aKing Joffrey Baratheon's reign is running now. As a wise man, he honors the history of his family. So, he commanded to build up two monuments, that will remind about some historical periods of the Baratheons.\u000aFormally, the Baratheons have been ruling for N years. Every year is described by an integer Ai, the level of prosperity in i-th year. If i-th year was a great year, then Ai might be a positive integer. Otherwise, if i-th year was a horrible year, then Ai might be a negative integer.\u000aEach historical period can be described as two integers S and F, the start and the finish of the period respectively. Of course, S is not greater than F for each period, that we consider in this task.\u000aYou are to pick two historical periods, but there are some rules:\u000aTwo periods shouldn't have common years. I.e. a period [1, 5] has no common years with a period [6, 7];\u000aThe first period should start earlier than the second one. I.e. a period [1, 5] starts earlier than [6, 7];\u000aTwo periods shouldn't be too close to each other. There must be at least K years between the finish of the first period and the start of the second period. I.e. periods [1, 5] and [10, 10] can be chosen in case K equals to 4, while they can't in case K equals to 5.\u000aThe sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years should be as big as possible.\u000aAfterwards, you should report the sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years to your King.
