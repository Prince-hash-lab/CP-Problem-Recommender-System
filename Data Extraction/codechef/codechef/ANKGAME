A game is played on these piles, in order from pile 1 to N. When the game is on the i-th pile, a player can remove any non-zero number of stones from this pile in a single move. If the current pile becomes empty, the game moves on to the next pile. The player who is unable to make a move loses.\u000aSrijan and Ankit are going to play this game. Ankit, being younger, always gets to start the game. However, Srijan, being clever, sneaks into the game arena early and permutes the order of piles. Then, the game is played on this new order of piles. Your task is to find out the number of orders in which the piles can be arranged so that Ankit wins the game. Assume that both the players play optimally. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7.\u000aNote that two orders are considered different if their contents are different.
