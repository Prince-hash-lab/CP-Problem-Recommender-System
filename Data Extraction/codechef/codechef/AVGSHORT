V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\u000aThere are a lot of problems related to the shortest paths. Nevertheless, there are not much problems, related to the shortest paths in average.\u000aConsider a directed graph G, consisting of N nodes and M edges. Consider a walk from the node A to the node B in this graph. The average length of this walk will be total sum of weight of its' edges divided by number of edges. Every edge counts as many times as it appears in this path.\u000aNow, your problem is quite simple. For the given graph and two given nodes, find out the shortest average length of the walk between these nodes. Please note, that the length of the walk need not to be finite, but average walk length will be.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\u000aThe first line of each test case contains a pair of space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of nodes and the number of edges in the graph.\u000aEach of the following M lines contains a triple of space-separated integers Xi Yi Zi, denoting the arc, connecting the node Xi to the node Yi (but not vice-versa!) having the weight of Zi.\u000aThe next line contains a pair of space separated integers A and B, denoting the first and the last node of the path.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, output a single line containing the length of the shortest path in average.\u000aIf there is no path at all, output just -1 on the corresponding line of the output.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 500\u000a1 \u2264 M \u2264 1000\u000aA is not equal to B\u000a1 \u2264 A, B, Xi, Yi \u2264 N\u000a1 \u2264 Zi \u2264 100\u000aThere are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph.\u000a1 \u2264 sum of N over all test cases \u2264 10000\u000a1 \u2264 sum of M over all test cases \u2264 20000\u000aSubtasks\u000aSubtask #1 (45 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 M \u2264 20; Your answer will be considered correct in case it has an absolute or relative error of no more than 10-2.\u000aSubtask #2 (55 points): no additional constraints; Your answer will be considered correct in case it has an absolute or relative error of no more than 10-6.\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a2\u000a3 3\u000a1 2 1\u000a2 3 2\u000a3 2 3\u000a1 3\u000a3 3\u000a1 2 10\u000a2 3 1\u000a3 2 1\u000a1 3\u000a\u000aOutput:\u000a1.5\u000a1.0\u000aExplanation\u000aExample case 1.
