V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\u000aToday is Devu's birthday. He has obtained few colored balloons from his friends. You are given this information by a string s consisting of lower case English Latin letters. Each letter (from 'a' to 'z') denotes a color. e.g. if s = "aab", then it means that he has received two balloons of color 'a' whereas one balloon of color 'b'.\u000aNow, Devu wants to decorate the cake by arranging all the balloons linearly from left to right on the cake such that no same colored balloons are nearby/ adjacent to each other.\u000aNow Devu wonders whether it is possible to do so or not? Please help him in this. If it is not possible to do so, print -1. Otherwise, print any one of arrangements of the balloons on the cake. If there are more than one possible ways of doing so, you can print any one of them.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
