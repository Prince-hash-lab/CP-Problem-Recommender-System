So, he decides to buy some amount of electric wires to connect the villeges without electricity to some villages with electricity. As Chef does not want to spend too much amount of money on wires, can you find out minimum amount of length of wire Chef should buy.\u000aInput\u000aFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
