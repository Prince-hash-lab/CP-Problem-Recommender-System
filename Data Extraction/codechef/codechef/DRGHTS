Each passageway connects two rooms, and there is at most one way to move between each pair of rooms. Some rooms have opened windows. There is a draught between two different rooms if both rooms have opened windows, and are connected with each other by some way.\u000aFurik is interested in one question: what is the number of pairs of rooms, which have a draught between them.
