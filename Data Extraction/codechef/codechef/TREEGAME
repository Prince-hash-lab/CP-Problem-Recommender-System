V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\u000aAlice and Bob are playing the game. Initially, there is a single rooted tree. Players take turns alternately, Alice starts.\u000aIn a single turn, Alice should choose any non-empty subset of roots of tree (or trees) and remove them. On the other hand, Bob should choose any non-empty subset of leafs and remove them from the tree (or trees). (Please note that Bob always takes some of the deepest in the original tree leafs.) It's not allowed to skip the turn. The game ends when a player can't take a turn.\u000aThe Alice's goal is to minimize the number of turns made by the both players, while Bob wants this number to be the maximal. Considering they both play optimally, what is the number of turns eventually made?\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
