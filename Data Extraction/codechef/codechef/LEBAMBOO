aVLittle Elephant from Zoo of Lviv likes bamboo very much. He currently has n stems of bamboo, Hi - height of i-th stem of bamboo (0-based numeration).
p19
aVToday inspector Andrii from World Bamboo Association is visiting the plantation. He doesn't like current situation. He wants the height of i-th stem to be Di, for each i from 0 to n-1, inclusive.
p20
aVLittle Elephant is going to buy some special substance. One bottle of such substance he can use to single stem of bamboo. After using substance for stem i, the height of i-th stem is decrased by 1 and the height of j-th stem is increased by 1 for each j not equal to i. Note that it is possible for some of the stems to have negative height, but after all transformations all stems should have positive height.
