V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\u000aYou are given a string S of length N consisting only of 0s and 1s. You are also given an integer K.\u000aYou have to answer Q queries. In the ith query, two integers Li and Ri are given. Then you should print the number of substrings of S[L, R] which contain at most K 0s and at most K 1s where S[L, R] denotes the substring from Lth to Rth characters of the string S.\u000aIn other words, you have to count number of pairs (i, j) of integers such that L \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 R such that no character in substring S[i, j] occurs more than K times.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
