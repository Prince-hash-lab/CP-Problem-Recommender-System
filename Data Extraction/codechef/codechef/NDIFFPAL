For example, the strings radar and noon are palindromes, whereas the string chef is not a palindrome as being read backwards is becomes equal to fehc, which is not equal to chef.\u000aLet's say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i \u2264 j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome.\u000aGiven an integer N.
