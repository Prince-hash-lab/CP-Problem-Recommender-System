V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aYou are playing following game: given an array A of N natural numbers. All numbers in the array A are at most M. On every turn you may pick any two different elements Ai and Aj (i\u2260j), such that Ai, Aj \u2264 M, and add K to both. The game ends when you are not able to continue. That is, when there is no pair (i,j) left such that both of them are less than equal to M.\u000aLet's call two arrays different if the sum of all their elements is different. When the game ends, you note down the final array A. How many different final arrays can you have.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains three integers N, M and K. N elements of the array follow in the next line.\u000aOutput\u000aOutput single integer - answer for the given problem modulo 109+7.\u000aConstraints\u000a1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\u000a1 \u2264 M,K \u2264 1012\u000a1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 M\u000aExample\u000aInput:\u000a3 3 2\u000a1 2 3\u000aOutput:\u000a2\u000aExplanation\u000aAll possible sums are 14 and 10.
