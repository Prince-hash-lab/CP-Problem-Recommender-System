Chef called such positive numbers easy numbers.\u000aThese numbers had an interesting property: Let the base Chef is currently studying be b. Represent the number in base b (without leading zeros). For each prefix of length k (from 1 to number of digits in number in the base), the number formed by considering the digits of the prefix in base b is divisible by k.\u000aFor example, let base Chef is studying be 2.\u000a1 is an easy number as its prefix of length 1 (i.e. 1) is divisible by 1.\u000a2 is also an easy number, as its prefix of length 1 (i.e. 1) is divisible by 1 and the prefix of length 2 (i.e. 2, represented as 10 in base 2) is also divisible by 2.\u000a3 is not an easy number, as its prefix of length 2 (i.e. 3, represented as 11 in base 2) is not divisible by 2.\u000aNow Chef finds these numbers easy and thinks that following question related to easy numbers will be easy for you too.
