V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aA number is called a square free number if there does not exist a number greater than 1, whose square divides the number evenly/perfectly. For example, number 8 is not a square free number as number 4 (which is square of 2), divides 8. Similarly, number 4 is also not a square free number. However numbers 1, 3, 6 all are square free numbers.\u000aA number n is called a good number if following properties hold.\u000aIt is a square free number.\u000aLet s denote the sum of all divisors of n (including non-trivial divisors like 1 and itself). Let c denote the number of prime numbers dividing s.
