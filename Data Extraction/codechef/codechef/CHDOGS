V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\u000aChef has three dogs sitting at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The length of each side of the triangle equals to s meters. Chef gives the command "Start!" and each dog starts to run with constant speed v meters per second. At each moment, each dog is running towards the dog just right to him (in counter-clockwise direction). Therefore, their trajectories are forming some spirals that converging to one point as illustrated below.\u000aHow long does it takes dogs to meet each other after the command "Start!"?\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\u000aThe only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers s and v.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each test case, output a single line containing a real number corresponding to the answer of the problem.
