V All submissions for this problem are available.\u000aA Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.\u000aThe Little Elephant calls some string T of the length M balanced if there exists at least one integer X (1 \u2264 X \u2264 M) such that the number of digits 4 in the substring T[1, X - 1] is equal to the number of digits 7 in the substring T[X, M]. For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\u000aThe Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and the substring S[L, R] is balanced.
