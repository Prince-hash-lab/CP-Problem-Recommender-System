Luckily, he wrote the encrypted password on a piece of paper, along with the rules for decryption.\u000aThe encrypted password is a string S consists of ASCII printable characters except space (ASCII 33 - 126, in decimal notation, the same below). Read here for more details: ASCII printable characters.\u000aEach rule contains a pair of characters ci, pi, denoting that every character ci appears in the encrypted password should be replaced with pi.

The shortest notation of this number is the real password. To get the shortest notation, we should delete all the unnecessary leading and trailing zeros.
