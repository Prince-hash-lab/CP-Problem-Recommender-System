Chef is well known for his delicious cakes with various flavors and shapes. One of his famous cakes is in the shape of a rooted binary tree of height H. The rooted binary tree has a very interesting property - for each non leaf node v, the height of the sub-tree rooted at the right child of v is exactly 1 more than that of the sub-tree rooted at the left child of node v. Note that the height of the leaf node of the tree is considered to be one and that of an empty subtree is considered to be zero. You can observe that the above property uniquely determines the rooted tree for a fixed height. So, instead of giving the entire rooted tree, we will just specify its height in the input.

In this game the player controls a long thin creature, resembling a snake that crawls on the rectangular field with width N and height M surrounded by walls. Snake itself consists of L links each of which occupies one cell of the field. Any two consecutive links of the snake must be in adjacent cells of the field and the snake should not have self-intersections (i.e. no two links of the snake can not be located in the same cell).  Snake moves all the time and the player cant stop it, but you can change the direction of its movement using cursor keys. The longer the player can control the snake avoiding self-intersections and collision with the wall the more points he earns. The snake moves in such a way that the first link (head) will occupy a cell adjacent to its previous position in the direction corresponding to the current pressed cursor key. Each successive snake link in a new position occupies the cell which was occupied by the previous link in the old position. Thus the connection of the snake is preserved. The cell which was occupied by the last link (tail) in the old position will be free. All movements made simultaneously so the cell that was occupied by the tail can be occupied by the head in the new position. If no key is pressed, the head of the snake will move in the same direction as in the previous move.  In the middle of a game, the Chef leaves the computer but does not shut down the game so the snake is now moving on its own.

For example, in the letter matrix: B X A X X X A X X X X B B X X X A X A X X X B X X The string ABA can be found in 14 different ways – corresponding to the following locations: A         B         A (1,1) (0,0) (1,1) (1,1) (2,2) (3,1) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (1,1) (2,2) (1,1) (3,1) (2,2) (3,1) (3,1) (2,2) (3,3) (3,1) (4,2) (3,1) (3,1) (4,2) (3,3) (3,1) (2,2) (1,1) (3,3) (2,2) (3,3) (3,3) (2,2) (1,1) (3,3) (2,2) (3,1) (3,3) (4,2) (3,1) (3,3) (4,2) (3,3)  So, given a matrix of size NxN, you need to find out the total number of locations of a particular string.

Cooks were slightly disappointed with this and went to consult their friends.  One of the geekiest friend gave them the idea of spreading knowledge through Facebook. But we do not want to spam peoples wall. So our cook came up with the idea of dividing Facebook users into small friend groups and then identify the most popular friend in each group and post on his / her wall. They started dividing users into groups of friends and identifying the most popular amongst them.  The notoriety of a friend is defined as the averaged distance from all the other friends in his / her group. This measure considers the friend himself, and the trivial distance of 0 that he / she has with himself / herself.  The most popular friend in a group is the friend whose notoriety is least among all the friends in the group.  Distance between X and Y is defined as follows: Minimum number of profiles that X needs to visit for reaching Ys profile(Including Ys profile). X can open only those profiles which are in the friend list of the current opened profile. For Example: - Suppose A is friend of B. - B has two friends C and D. - E is a friend of D.  Now, the distance between A and B is 1, A and C is 2, C and E is 3.  So, one of our smart cooks took the responsibility of identifying the most popular friend in each group and others will go to persuade them for posting. This cheeky fellow knows that he can release his burden by giving this task as a long contest problem.  Now, he is asking you to write a program to identify the most popular friend among all the friends in each group.

MA denotes your initial MP (magical points), which is used when you use a skill. Note that only you can use a skill in the battle. In each turn, the battle will go on as follows: Firstly, you can use a skill as many times as you like as long as your MP is positive. If you use a skill, your HP and Shindannins HP are decreased by half and your MP is decreased by 1. If HP becomes a non-integer, HP will be rounded up to the nearest integer. To be more precise, new HP will be ceil(old HP / 2). Next, an integer s is chosen in [0, SA] uniformly randomly, and an integer t is chosen in [0, SB] uniformly randomly. Then, your HP is decresed by t, and Shindannins HP is decreased by s simultaneously. If both fighter have positive HP, next turn will occur. When a fighters HP is down to zero or a negative integer, this fighter loses. If both fighters HP is down to zero or negative integer simultaneously, you will fight against Shindannin again with the same conditions, that is, HP and MP are recovered completely before next battle. There is no limit on the number of rematches. If you fight optimally, what is your winning percentage? Input An input contains 5 integers VA, VB, SA, SB and MA.

A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7. The Little Elephant has N favorite strings S1, S2, ..., SN and the favorite number K. Each character in Si (1 ? i ? N) is either the lucky digit (4 or 7) or the question mark ?. Consider some non-decreasing lucky string S. In other words, S has one of the following forms: 444...444, 777...777, 444...444777...777.

(114, 'HOB', 'https://www.codechef.com/problems/HOB', 'All submissions for this problem are available. Byteland has always been popular among tourists. Seeing a business opportunity, Chef has built a brand new Hotel Balifornia there. The hotel has R unique comfortable rooms for guests purpose. The rooms are numbered by integers from 0 to R-1, inclusive. All rooms in the hotel are on the same floor and arranged in a circle. Namely, the room next to the room 0 is the room 1; the room next to the room 1 is the room 2; ... the room next to the room R-2 is the room R-1; finally, the room next to the room R-1 is the room 0. When R = 1 we have only one room and it is next to itself. Below, we will be needing the notion of k-th next room to the given room. It should be quite clear from the notation what does it mean but lets define it formally to avoid any ambiguities. The 1-st next room to the room r is simply the next room to the room r. Assume that the notion of (k-1)-th next room is already defined. Then the k-th next room to the room r is the room next to the (k-1)-th next room to the room r. At the time of check-in, among other things, the guest is required to provide his first name and the number of hours he will be staying in the hotel. Chef has sent a special machine called Room Number Generator (RNG) for allocating the rooms to the guests. The RNG takes a string (the first name of the guest) as the input and returns the room id. This is how RNG does it: The string is composed of lowercase and uppercase letters of English alphabet. At first, uppercase letters (from A to Z, inclusive) are replaced by the corresponding lowercase letters: A by a, B by b, ..., Z by z. Next, each letter is replaced by an integer value: a by 1, b by 2, ..., z by 26. Then we consider thus obtained list of positive integers as a representation of some integer in base 33. Namely, if D1, D2, ..., DL is the list of integers obtained after encoding all the letters we will consider the following value: D1 * 33L-1 + D2 * 33L-2 + ... + DL-1 * 33 + DL. Finally, RNG takes the remainder of division of the number, obtained at the previous step, by the number of rooms in the hotel. So this will be (D1 * 33L-1 + D2 * 33L-2 + ... + DL-1 * 33 + DL) mod R. This value is the room id returned by RNG. Well, at least Chef deems that RNG returns this value... Consider some examples: Ab will be at first replaced by ab and then will be represented as 1 * 33 + 2 = 35. If the number of rooms in the hotel is 40 then the room will be 35 mod 40 = 35. Chef will be at first replaced by chef and then will be represented as 3 * 333 + 8 * 332 + 5 * 33 + 6 = 116694. If the number of rooms in the hotel is 37 then the room will be 116694 mod 37 = 33. Chef noted that for some unlucky values of R regardless of the name of the guest, RNG returns only rooms from some range that does not cover all rooms in the hotel. This, of course, would be disaster for Chef. For example, for R = 33 rooms 0, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 can not be the values returned by RNG. Chef is smart guy and quickly realizes that this happens if and only if R is divisible by 33. Hence he ensures that the number of rooms in the hotel is not divisible by 33. The hotel manager was having fun time, RNGing the names of his acquaintances, just when he discovered that his wifes RNG number came out the same as his friends! Horrified he visited the VP and explained the problem that different guests may end up in the same room. The VP thought for a moment, and then suggested that the one who comes later be allotted a different room. How clever! But which room? The hotel management fought for several days over this. Ultimately the lift boys scheme was taken up. The lift boy is fond of sequences and number theory. Hence he will use the following sequence in his scheme: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ... Here each term of the sequence, starting from the 4-th one, equals to the sum of three previous terms. We denote the n-th term of this sequence as An. So A1 = 1, A2 = 2, A3 = 3, A4 = 6, and so on. Assume that RNG number of the current guest is r0. At first we check the room r0 and if it is free we settle guest in this room. Otherwise, we check the room r1 which is A1-th next to the room r0. If it is free we settle guest in this room. Note that since A1 = 1 then, actually, r1 is simply the next room to r0. Otherwise, we check the room r2 which is A2-th next to the room r1. If it is free we settle guest in this room. Note that since A2 = 2 then, r2 is the room, next to the room that is next to the room r1 (ignore this, if it blows your mind). In general, at k-th step we have all rooms r0, r1, ..., rk-1 occupied and we check the room rk which is Ak-th next to the room rk-1. If it is free we settle guest in this room and finish the process. Otherwise we continue. If we cant find the free room in any finite number of steps, we inform the guest that we unable to settle him. In this case we provide him the minimal number of minutes after which he could come again so that we could find the free room for him by the above scheme, assuming that we start the process again from the room r0. Please, be sure that you are using exactly this definition to find the required number of minutes. According to some weird facts about RNG below, the room RNGing to the guest later could differ from r0, but we still use the old value to perform the lift boys scheme. Actually, no guest will return back to the hotel if we ask him to come back later without settling him in some room. The reason is that only celebrities visit Chefs hotel (see the example ;)) and they take a huge offense to the Chef if they were not settled in any room. Hence they will never return to the hotel again in this case. So actually we inform them the minimal number of minutes just out of courtesy :) Chef hears this and is a bit worried about guests response, so he requests you to analyze the inconvenience that will be caused to the guests. If the guest was settled in some room, the inconvenience equals to the least integer k for which the room rk is free, so, actually, it is the number of rooms that was found occupied while processing this guest. Otherwise it is equal to the number of minutes he should wait to come again if no free room was found for him by lift boys scheme. After invention of the lift boys scheme Chef also realizes that his old fears about unlucky values of R is useless but still he believes that values of R divisible by 33 could lead to larger average guests inconvenience than other values of R. So, just in case, he still ensures that R is not divisible by 33. What Chef and hotel management does not realize is that RNG has a mind of its own. Dont get scared! It just remembers the inconvenience caused to each guest and it uses this information to adjust the returned value. Namely, RNG add to the initial RNG value described above the sum of inconveniences caused to all previous guests. Then this number is taken modulo R to get the correct room number and RNG returns it. See example for clarity. You will be given the list of all visits to the Hotel Balifornia in increasing order of time and should output the inconvenience caused to each guest. To make the output more readable print the dash before the inconvenience of each guest that was not settled in any room. Also note that Chefs hotel is very popular, so the time interval between two consecutive visits is strictly less than 24 hours. Hence we will be providing only hour and minute of the day for each visit. We could have several visits at the same moment of time. In this case we process guests in order they appear in the input. If we have a visiting guest and some other guest leaving the hotel at the same moment, then the room which will be vacated by the leaving guest will be considered as free when applying the lift boys scheme to the visiting guest. The same is true when deciding the waiting minutes for not settled guests. We assume that all guests are different. But they could have equal first names.

The rows and colums of the table are indexed starting from 1. A[i][j] denotes the jth integer in the ith row of A. Lets consider some sequence (i1, j1), (i2, j2), ..., (iK, jK)(1 ? K) of the table cells. A sequence of table cells is said to be a valid Ghariyal-path if all of the following conditions holds: (i1, j1) equals to (1, 1) - the top-left cell of the table (iK, jK) equals to (N, M) - the bottom-right cell of the table it ? it + 1 for each integer 1 ? t < K jt ? jt + 1 for each integer 1 ? t < K |it + 1 - it| + |jt + 1 - jt| = 1 for each integer 1 ? t < K One can easily prove that the length of any valid Ghariyal-path is exactly N + M - 1 cells. Its also easy to prove that any valid Ghariyal-path contains any of the table cells at most once. Mr. KG asked Aayan to cover the given table with valid Ghariyal-paths. To be precise, his task is to find the minimal number of valid Ghariyal-paths such that for any table cell with coordinates (i, j) the following condition is satisfied: at least A[i][j] valid Ghariyal-paths contain the (i, j)-cell.', ' dilworth dp kostya_by ltime32 maxflow partial-ord', '15', 'Constraints 1 ?

Their order matters. Some decorations look really similar. Generally, two arrangements (lets call them A and B) are similar if B is a cyclic shift of A, or B is a reversed cyclic shift of A.

For any two students with roll numbers next to each other, VS ensures that the one with the higher favouritism value gets strictly more than twice the marks received by the less favourite student. The paper consisted of many problems and each problem must be graded with either the full score allotted to that problem, or zero score. Since he does not want to get caught, VS must make sure that the number of marks awarded to any student must be expressible as a sum of maximum possible scores of problems, repeated any number of times. For example, suppose that the problems in the problem set carry marks from the set {2,5,7}. Clearly, no student can be awarded 1 mark. 7 marks may be awarded, as 7 = 2 + 5. 4 marks may also be handed out, as 4 = 2 + 2. Note that 0 marks can be awarded as well. One of the students, Sahil, aspires to top the class, and is therefore very concerned about the marks he would get. While Sahil topping the class could have really been possible if the exam was on The Harry Potter series, his chances are rather bleak on a Computer Science test. So, he finds out the fav array by breaking into VSs office, and uses this information to find the minimum possible average of marks obtained by the class and judge the ground reality. It is certain that VS never violates the conditions mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. Print the minimum possible average.

She then picks up a Muggle book on Graph Theory and starts reading about rooted K-ary trees: Trees that are rooted and in which each node has at most K children. Since Transfiguration is her favorite subject at Hogwarts, she excitedly starts inventing a spell to Transfigure some such trees into others. After a while, she has succeeded in her spell. However, she notices something strange about the transfigured tree. Suppose she started with the tree T, and transfigured it into tree T. Then, she found that the preorder traversal of T was the same as the preorder traversal of T, and that the postorder traversal of T was also the same as the postorder traversal of T. She then realizes that her spell is capable of transfiguring tree T into another tree T only if the preorder and postorder traversals of both are the same. She thus wonders, given a particular permutation of nodes P1 and another permutation of nodes P2, along with the value of K, how many rooted K-ary trees T are there that the preorder traversal of T is P1, and the postorder traversal of T is P2. We give the explicit pseudocode of the preorder and postorder traversals of rooted K-ary trees: class node int label; node children[K]; //children[i] is null if the ith child is not present  void preorder(node subroot) output subroot.label; for(int i = 0; i < K; i++) if(subroot.children[i] != null) preorder(subroot.children[i]);  void postorder(node subroot) for(int i = 0; i < K; i++) if(subroot.children[i] != null) postorder(subroot.children[i]); output subroot.label; Two rooted K-ary trees T1 and T2 are considered different if there is some node n, such that the children[] array of node n is different in T1 and in T2.

A construction company has agreed to build 1 fly-over for a payment of C rupees. It is up to the Chef to decide which restaurants he wants to connect using fly-overs. He asks his assistant chefs to give him suggestions. Each assistant chef proposes his own model. The Chef is now confused, he has no way of comparing models. Some models have too many fly-overs, while other models have too few. The Sous Chef came up with a formula to estimate the Cost of a model. Suppose the model has F fly-overs. Lets label restaurants by numbers 1, 2, ..., N. Let T(U, V) represents the time taken to go from the restaurant U to the restaurant V via fly-overs of the current model. Compute T(X, Y) for every ordered pair of distinct restaurants (X, Y) (N ? (N – 1) pairs in total) and then add them up. Denote obtained sum as P and called it the time penalty of the model. Note that the constructing of F fly-overs will cost C ? F rupees. The Sous Chef strongly believes that saving time is equivalent to saving money, so the total cost of the model is simply P + C ? F. The Head Chef is somewhat satisfied. As a specialist in math and graph theory he immediately found a formula for the cost of the optimal model for a given C. But the construction company has a special offer now. It can construct fly-overs between M special pairs of restaurants for free. Now the problem of finding the optimal model becomes non-trivial for The Chef and he turns to you for help.', ' functions graphs june12 medium shettynamit', '3', 'Constraints 1 ? T ? 1000 1 ?

Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian. Mandarin Chinese Russian El Machos army of mutated minions is marching towards Gru, the army is standing in a rectangular formation measuring NxM. The spray of antidotes done by Gru has turned some of the minions back to normal, but now they are trapped within the army of mutated ones. Formally, a normal minion is not trapped if :  1) either he is on one of the edges of the rectangle  2) or one of his direct neighbors (directly in front/back of him, or left/right of him) is not trapped.    Any trapped minion will be killed by the mutated minions, which Gru cannot let happen. Gru will use his antidote ray to turn exactly one row and one column of the army to normal minions. If there are any normal minions in that row or column, they remain unaffected. Can Gru select a row and a column such that no normal minion remains trapped after the antidote ray?    INPUT:  First line contains T, number of testcases  Each testcase starts with a line containing two space separated integers N and M.

Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian. Mandarin Chinese Russian Tracy is teaching Charlie maths via a game called N-Cube, which involves three sections involving N.  Tracy gives Charlie a number N, and Charlie makes a list of Nth powers of integers in increasing order (1N, 2N, 3N.. so on). This teaches him exponentiation.  Then Charlie performs the following subtraction game N times : Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if N was 6, the list proceeds as [1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ] to [63, 685, 3367 ...], and so on 5 more times.  After the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the Nth element of the list. This number is the value of the game.    After practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers M (where M is a prime) and R instead of just a single number N, and the game must start from MR - 1 instead of N. Since the value of the game can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer K such that M K divides this number. Since even K can be large, output K modulo 1000000007 (109+7).

Aliens again had stolen the important data about the Birth of the Human beings and as before they keep this data in their secured Data Center. With the help of these data along with the advanced technologies Aliens had initiated a project called Its The End to get rid of the human beings and occupy the Earth. Stupid humans! How could they allow this again?! Chef Po has thought and started connecting to the Aliens Data Center to save the Earth again. The first thing he noticed is that there are N servers in the Aliens Data Center and they are arranged in a line. Aliens have rearranged the Data Center to avoid Grid Hacking Mechanism (refer to this, but this is not needed to understand this problem). Denote the i-th server as Server[i] (1 ? i ? N). Aliens had divided the Data File with the data about the Birth of the Human beings into N parts denoted as F[i] (1 ? i ? N) and placed the part F[i] at the Server[i]. Each server has a password - a non-negative integer. Chef Po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the Data File. The Aliens are really strange beings, so they single out two types of passwords: Power Password - a number of the form AB (A, B ? 2). The list of Power Passwords starts with 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, ... Non-Power Password - any other number. This list starts with 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, ... For simplicity we shall call server secured by a Power Password as Power Server and the server secured by a Non-Power Password as Non-Power Server. All Non-Power Servers have a friendly screen with the color indicator. Suppose you enter a password trying to guess the actual password of such a server. The indicator will then become green if you enter a number which is smaller than the actual password; it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password, or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct. On the other hand, each Power Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all Power Passwords until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of Power Passwords in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password. After the last adventure with Aliens, Chef became smarter so he will use binary search to crack Non-Power Servers. Namely, let A[1], A[2], A[3], A[4], ... be the sequence of all Non-Power Passwords. At first he will try passwords A[2], A[4], A[8], A[16], ... until he either reaches the correct one or the indicator becomes red for the first time. If indicator becomes red at the password A[2] = 1 then he enters A[1] = 0 at the next step and cracks the server (since 0 is the only Non-Power Password less than 1). Let the indicator becomes red at the password A[2k] where k ? 2 while for the password A[2k?1] indicator was green. Then Chef sets L = 2k?1, R = 2k and uses usual binary search to crack the server after that. Namely, at each step he sets M = (L + R) div 2 and checks the password A[M]. If it is correct he finishes the process; if indicator becomes green he sets L = M and continue the process; finally, if indicator becomes red he sets R = M and continue the process. Lets consider some examples: Suppose the password is 9. Its a Power Password, so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a Power Server. Hence he will try the password 4, then 8 and then 9, making 3 tries in all. Suppose the password is 0. Its a Non-Power Password, so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a Non-Power Server. Hence he will try the passwords A[2] = 1, A[1] = 0 in order, making 2 tries in all. Suppose the password is 7. Its a Non-Power Password. Hence he will try the passwords A[2] = 1, A[4] = 3, A[8] = 10, A[6] = 6, A[7] = 7 in order, making 5 tries in all. Suppose the password is 1. Its a Non-Power Password. He will crack this server from the first try since A[2] = 1. You are the secret Aliens agent that got to know about Chefs plan. Your first goal is to estimate the time Chef will spend on cracking each server so that Aliens headquarters would know how much time they have to stop the Chef.

A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7. He is now studying some special transformation defined on the set of the lucky strings. The lucky string T is called a swap permutation of the lucky string S with |S| = N if it can be derived from S by the following process. Choose some integers L and R such that 1 ? L ? R ? N. Denote by A the substring S[L, R] and by B the concatenation S[1, L - 1] + S[R + 1, N]. Choose some integer K such that 0 ? K ? |B|. Put T = B[1, K] + A + B[K + 1, |B|].  In other words, T is a swap permutation of S if it can be obtained from S by deleting some non-empty substring from S and then inserting it back into any position of S. Note that S is always a swap permutation of itself. Denote by F(S) the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of S. In other words, this subsequence should have one of the following forms: 444...444, 777...777, 444...444777...777. The Little Elephant has the lucky string S and as an experienced theoretical scientist he is interested in some quite theoretical problem. Namely, he wants to find the maximal value of F(T) if T can be an arbitrary swap permutation of S. Help him and find this value. Notes. Let S be some lucky string. Then |S| denotes the length of the string S; S[i] (1 ? i ? |S|) denotes the ith character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1); S[L, R] (1 ? L ? R ? |S|) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R], and is called a substring of S. For L > R we mean by S[L, R] an empty string.  For any two lucky strings S and T their concatenation is defined as the sequence of characters in S followed by the sequence of characters in T, and is denoted by S + T. The string T is called a subsequence of the string S if T can be derived from S by deleting some (possibly zero) number of characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, T = 474 is a subsequence of S = 74477747 since after deleting characters at positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 from S we obtain T.

Its a contest where different teams of different Chefs compete against each other. Our Chef wants to send one of the best teams from his entire staff. Selecting a good team is not about having the best people, but it is about having members who can cooperate and work well with each other. Chef is very aware of this fact. So he chooses the following strategy to decide a team. He lines up all his N cooks in a line. Each of these cooks has a skill level associated with him. Denote the level of the i-th cook as skill[i] for 1 ? i ? N. Let us make a few points on a team formation. A team can have any number of cooks. Each team should consist of consecutive cooks. So, for example, cooks with positions 3, 4, 5 can form a team, but cooks with positions 4, 5, 7, 8 can not. A team is a candidate team if the difference between the maximum skill and the minimum skill of the cooks in the team does not exceed the threshold C. A cook can be in 0 or more candidate teams. Which means that candidate teams can intersect. Two candidate teams are considered to be different if there exists at least one cook who is in one team but not in the other. Chef has not yet decided the team of what size he is going to send to the battle. To be precise we note, that the team size is the total number of cooks in it. For the given team size Chef wants to consider all candidate teams of this size according to the rules described above, evaluate them for himself and choose the best one. Denote the total number of candidate teams for the given size K as cand[K]. To increase the chances of choosing better team he wants the number of candidate teams to be as large as possible. But Chef is a human and cant evaluate too many teams. The maximal number of teams he can evaluate depends on many factors such as his mood or fatigue. We call it the Chefs limit. Denote the current Chefs limit as M. Since Chef still wants the total number of candidate teams to be as large as possible you need to find the team size K such that cand[K] ? M, among all such K find the value for which cand[K] is maximal and if such K is not unique find the minimal K among them. Since Chefs limit always changes according to his mood or fatigue you should find the required team size for several values of M. Chef also wants to know the total number of candidate teams for the size you will find. There will be Q values of M in all.

He has spent considerable time trying to find a solution but in vain. So he turns to you to find the solution using your special powers of coding. For a positive integer N, he defines a function DIVPRO(N) as follows. Let N be L-digit number and ni is the i-th digit in the decimal representation of N (i = 1, 2, ..., L). So we can write N = n1n2...nL. Then DIVPRO(N) = n1 / n2 * n3 / n4 * ... (i.e., we alternate division and multiplication of digits). The result is calculated from left to right. Division here is performed in standard mathematical way, so the result of the division can be non-integer number. If division by 0 occurs at any point for a given N, then DIVPRO(N) is undefined in such a case. Lets consider some examples: DIVPRO(1) = 1. In fact, DIVPRO(N) = N for any 1-digit number N. DIVPRO(42) = 4 / 2 = 2 is an integer. DIVPRO(123) = 1 / 2 * 3 = 3 / 2 = 1.5 is non-integer. DIVPRO(370) = 3 / 7 * 0 = 0, while intermediate result was 3 / 7 which is non-integer. DIVPRO(3465009) = 3 / 4 * 6 / 5 * 0 / 0 * 9 is undefined since we have division by zero.

Top-2 maximum means the first two elements of the ratings sorted in non-increasing order. Due to bugs in the system, an unexpected update occurs after output of each query and this creates a new version of the ratings array V. We refer the Kth version of the ratings arrays as VK. Also, for a query, the system queries on some previous version of V. Mr. Bunny gave the exact details of the bugs as follows,  Given Q queries numbered 1 to Q in order and values of A B C D M, For a query number K, the query is made on the array Vt , where t = ( A * R1 + D ) % K, and R1 is the maximum rating in the query range of the previous query. For the first query, consider R1 = 0.  For a query number K, let R1 and R2 be the top-2 maximum ratings ( R1 ? R2 ). After it outputs this answer, the system changes the rating of a player. Specifically, the rating of player number ( B * R1 + D ) % N is changed to ( C * R2 + D ) % M. This update is on the array V(K-1) and a new version VK is created.

Its our Chefs Birthday next week. His friends want to gift him something very nice and useful. They know how much Chef likes to go out on trips. So they decide to gift him a caravan i.e a travel trailer. As is clear from the description, a caravan is towed behind a car. All the friends have chipped in a few dollars and now they have D dollars in total to buy a caravan. But theres one more thing they need to worry about. Caravans are sold outside their city. They will have to travel through various toll booths to buy one and bring it back. And they will have to pay some amount from their total D when they cross these toll booths. Luckily, they will not have to pay any toll for their own car(well, being Chefs friend has a lot of perks). But they will have to pay the toll for the caravan. They dont want to be spending too much on their tolls. Needless to say, they cant skip the toll booths. travel trailer  D D There are m different roads between the Chefs city and the place where the caravans are sold. Each road takes a different route. There are n toll booths on every road. But an interesting observation is that the toll for a caravan need not be same for every road AND it also need not be same at every toll booth on the same road. m n not AND not The friends want to gift him the most expensive caravan(which they can afford) and want to spend as little on tolls as they can. So m of the friends decide to travel on each of the roads individually. And once they buy a caravan, any one of them can start towing it behind his car. Also, a friend can move the caravan to some other friends car i.e. to some other road. This is done so as to minimize the total toll. But theres another thing to be taken care of here. The caravan is not easy to move. So, there are mechanics available on every road who can do this. And theres a fixed amount they will charge to move the caravan from one road to another. This amount depends on the source and destination road between which the caravan is moved. But, theres a small restriction on the movement of the caravan. If the caravan has crossed the ith toll booth on a road, it can only be moved to a location before the (i+1)th booth on the other road. Initially, the caravan can be taken on any road. m i i+1 Chefs friends will not want to buy an expensive caravan and find out later that they are out of money to pay for the toll. Nor do they want to end up buying a less expensive caravan and realize they could have bought a more expensive one. So they have collected all the details and want you to help them. Your task is to tell them the maximum amount they can spend on buying a caravan assuming they have D dollars initially and they have sufficient amount left to pay for the caravan toll. Input: First line of input contains T, number of tests. Each test begins with a line containing 3 space separated integers: D, n and m: total amount of money, the number of toll booths on every road and the number of roads respectively. Then follow m lines. Each line consists of n integers describing every road in order. The ith number in a line denotes the toll for the caravan at the ith toll booth on the respective road. Then follows an mxm matrix, C, where the jth number on the ith row i.e. C[i][j] signifies the cost of moving the caravan from the ith road to the jth road. Ofcourse, C[i][i]=0.    Output: Output a single integer: the maximum amount they will be able to spend on a caravan. If they dont have enough money to pay for the toll, print -1 instead.

Now Chef is very good in cooking; his dishes are the best in the city, so he wants to make his restaurant prettier. The first, what customer sees, when comes to his restaurant is the door. So he will start with it. He has found a new design last night. Hi will cut out some circles from the door and fill the holes by the glass to make windows of peculiar form. Formally, we can model the process Chef will perform to create the windows as follows. Let the door be a rectangle at the coordinate plane with corners at the points (0, 0), (W, 0), (0, H), (W, H). Initially the door is colored white, while the remaining part of the coordinate plane is colored black. At each step Chef colors in black some circle including all its inner points. After Chef will color all required circles, the black part of the door (that is, black regions that lie in the rectangle corresponding to the door) is cut out and replaced by the glass. The main measure of peculiarity of the door is the perimeter of all the windows considering only those parts of windows borders lying inside the door (see example case 2 for clarity).

For illustration, consider a Jam Board Having 6 Columns and 2 Rows- A B C D E F A B C D E F A B C D E F A B 1 D E F A B C D 2 F G H I J K L G H I J K L G H I J K L G 3 I J K L G H I J K L All As are in a group, and share same voltage. Notice the 3 above, it is basically in H group. How can we refer to the point 3 on Jam Board, using coordinate system? Candy for taking a guess! It is (2, 9), from Top Left. Now if Jimmy plugs one end of copper wire in 1 and the other in 2, then C and E will become a single group and start sharing voltage. Jimmy can apply a high voltage to any hole, and that group becomes high. The Jam Board is grounded, thus each group is initially at low voltage. When an LED is connected across two points, it glows up if there is a potential difference between the two points, i.e. when one end is high and the other is low. The lab assistant must leave, but he allows Jimmy to stay with one Jam Board, one LED, one Voltage sources (with several output points) and lots of wires. So Jimmy gets down to work, he connects wires, applies (high) voltage, and occasionally connects the LED between two points. Sometimes he removes a voltage source as well. At times he connects a wire(or voltage source) to the point, which already has a wire(or voltage source) connected to it. This is not a good practice, but Jimmy is excused because he is new to electrical stuff. And when he removes voltage source from a point, he removes only one of it at a time. Since the number of connections is rather enormous and confusing, he requires your help to tell him whether the LED will light up each time he connects it. However Jimmys cryptography classes have made him rather irksome. He is telling you the row or column not as a number, but in a Base-52 notation of his own. In this notation, each number is represented as 2 characters, where each character can be either A-Z or a-z. Here A = 0, B = 1, ... Z = 25, a = 26, ... z = 51. So 1 is represented as AB, 5 is AF, 97 is Bt. And to top that he doesnt give any gap between row number and column number, or between pair of coordinates (column and row), used to indicate the endpoints of wire.', ' disjoint-set medium nov12 vinayak garg', '18', '', 'True', 'medium', ' disjoint-set medium nov12 vinayak garg', '0.5', '50000'),

Johnny, a computer science student from the Bytelandian Technological University (BTU), has finally managed to write a program to solve the N queens problem. However, his version of the N queens problem is not really all that similar to the classical one. Recall that in the N queens problem, there is a square chessboard of size NxN. The goal is to put N queens on the chessboard so that no two queens would be able to attack each other. In Johnnys version of the problem (which he states to be much harder than the original one), there are K blocked squares given on the chessboard. The goal is still the same: to put N queens on the chessboard such that no two queens would be able to attack each other. However, there are some differences due to the existence of blocked squares. First, a queen cannot be put on a blocked square. Secondly, two queens are considered to be able to attack each other only if there is no blocked square between them. Finally, there must be exactly one queen on every column of the board. Johnny claims that his program solves the above problem very effectively. He generates some test cases (which his program can solve within minutes) to challenge you. You know the method Johnny used to generate the test case. For a given N, Johnny randomly picks a number K between 1 and N2/2 with equal probability. After that, Johnny picks K blocked squares on the chess board.

Amortized analysis deals with analyzing the average amount of work done per operation over a series of operations. In some cases, the average amount of work done per operation is dramatically less than the worst case analysis indicates. A typical example is counting the number of times a bit is flipped in a ripple-carry counter. A ripple-carry counter is an implementation of a binary counter where incrementing from B to B+1 is done in the following manner. Say the binary number is represented as B = bn-1b_n-2...b_1b0 where bi is the bit corresponding to 2i.

At any time unit, the set of gangsters who are present in the party enjoy drinking together and become friends. After the party, the law enforcement agency in the city is suspecting that there has been some conspiracy for sabotage in the city. So they feel that it is necessary to interrogate several gangsters. But they dont have time to interrogate all of them. They are suspecting that there are X gangsters involved in this conspiracy. It is natural that those X gangsters will be friends with each other.  Now the enforcement agency have got the idea. They want to interrogate the gangsters in such a way that for each subset of X friend gangsters (where each pair of gangsters in that subset are friends), there will be at least one interrogated gangster from that subset. But to save their time, they want to interrogate minimum number of gangsters. Given the information of the gangsters and number X, help them to find the minimum number of gangsters to be interrogated.  Note: Two gangsters are friends if they have common time in the club. For example, the gangster entering at time 1 and leaving at time 3 can be a friend with another gangster entering at time 3 and leaving some time afterwards.

To that effect, we have an online interface where potential buyers of domain names can check the availability of domain names, and find out how much it is going to cost them. Domain tasting is a frowned upon practice in our industry wherein people register domain names that are typos of existing domain names in order to make money through displaying ads to the traffic received on these typos. For instance if one were to register directo.com one could potentially get traffic from people who were trying to reach directi.com but instead mis-typed the last character. In order to disincentivize tasters from registering typos of existing domain names, we wish to levy a surcharge on a domain name which is a typo of an existing domain name. The amount of surcharge would depend on the type and number of transformations required to convert an existing domain to a domain name that someone wishes to register. The following type of transformations exist alongwith their cost - If a transformation requires insertion of one character, it costs 1 point If a transformation requires deletion of one character, it costs 1 point If a transformation requires replacement of one character, it costs 2 points, except where the character being replaced and its replacement are adjacent to one another on the same line of a qwerty keyboard, in which case it costs 1 point  These operations can be performed in any order, so for example, to transform the domain name directi to iriecti, we can either do a deletion of d in directi followed by an insertion of i or perform an insertion followed by the deletion. Similarly, iriecti can be transformed to directi by performing an insertion of d followed by a deletion of i or vice-versa.

Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese After the Great ChefLand War, ChefTown consisted of N historical junctions with a sightseeing place in each of them and M cobbled roads, connecting them. It is possible to reach any junction from any other one, possibly, via intermediate junctions. The ChefTown Restoration Committee (CTRC) now wants to make the town more convenient, thus, attractive, for the tourists. The essential requirement for the old town is to be in the center of the city. For this purpose, each junction V has a parameter d(V) denoting to the maximal shortest distance (in number of roads taken) you need to pass in order to reach some other junction, introduced by the CTRC. Let us take an example. Here you have 5 junctions with 5 roads, connecting them. Inside the circle, there is a number of a junction (in black), near the circle, there is a number d(V) (in yellow) corresponding to this junction. Consider the junction, numbered 1. We have d(1) = 2 because, you can reach any other junction, passing no more than two roads. In fact, you can reach the junctions 2 and 3 directly, thus, the distance to them is 1. In order to reach the junction 4 you need to go to the junction 2 and then directly to the junction 4. The same way you can reach the junction 5 using 2 roads. Of course, you could have travelled to the junction number 4 another way: you could moved to the junction number 3, then to the junction number 2 and then, finally, to the junction number 4 and that would have taken three roads. But we are interested only in the shortest distances, thus, we have d(1) = 2. If we consider the junction 5, it will take one road to go to the junction 3, two roads to go to the junctions 1 and 2 and three roads to go to the junction 4. So we have d(5) = 3. Lets call the junction a central one in case its parameter of d(V) is minimal among all the junctions in the town. On the example above, the junctions numbered 1, 2, 3 are central, and the junctions numbered 4, 5 are not. Now, CTRC wants to build some new junctions (possibly none) with brand new shops and fast food and new asphalt roads connecting them in such a way that all the historical junctions are central in the town. In order to avoid the mess, none of newly built non-historical junctions should be central. Moreover, by the regulations of CTRC itself, it is prohibited to build an asphalt road between two historical junctions because it violates the spirit of old times. All the roads in ChefTown, namely those that were built initially and those that will be built by CTRC are bi-directional. The CTRC is now short in terms of money. It has sufficient funds only to build no more than 2N new junctions and no more than N * (N - 1) new roads.

I hope all of you remember that Chef built a Hotel Balifornia in Byteland and some complicated scheme for allocating guests, invented by lift boy, was used. But after realizing all badness of this scheme Chef fired lift boy and simplifies the process of allocating guests drastically. Now at the time of check-in each guest only provides the preferable room for him and the number of minutes he will stay in the hotel. After that the hotel manager finds the first available room starting from the provided one assuming that rooms in the hotel are arranged in cyclic manner. Namely, let there be R rooms in the hotel and they are numbered by numbers from 0 to R ? 1, inclusive. Suppose guest chooses the room K. Then the hotel manager checks rooms in order K, K + 1, K + 2, ..., R ? 2, R ? 1, 0, 1, 2, ..., K ? 2, K ? 1 and allocates the guest in the first free room in this list or report the guest that all rooms are occupied if this is the case.  Chef has a logbook where hotel manager writes down information about each guest. Namely, he records the visit time, the preferable room for the guest (NOT the actual room where guest will live), the staying time and the inconvenience caused to the guest, which equals to the number of occupied rooms that hotel manager checks in the list above before allocating the guest (or R if all rooms are occupied). The visit time is provided in minutes after the moment when hotel was opened for visits. Before the first visit all rooms in the hotel were free. When guest leaves the room it could be occupied at the same moment of time by another guest if exactly at this moment the visit occurs. But lift boy prepared the revenge to the Chef.

Chef needs to recover the damage quickly since only a few hours left before inspector visit. He knows about your advanced skills in programming and asks you for help.

Appearing as one of the nine Wonders Made by Man in the book by Lomas Longstrider, the Wall is defended and held by the Sworn Brothers of the Nights Watch, who patrol and guard the castles from the Frostfangs mountain range in the west to the Bay of Seals in the east. (c) A Wiki of Ice and Fire Winter is coming. The army of White Walkers is heading to the south. The Wall is the only obstacle, that protects the people of the Seven Kingdoms from the danger. In this problem we assume, that the Wall can be described as a rectangle R on the Cartesian plane. The corner points of R are (0, 0), (0, H), (W, H) and (W, 0). In order to reinforce the Wall, the brothers of the Nights Watch have placed a huge simple polygonal chain P made of the purest valyrian steel on the wall. P can be desribed as following: P consists of N points, both coordinates of which are integers; The points are indexed with integers from 0 to N - 1; X-coordinate of ith point of P equals to Xi; Y-coordinate of ith point of P equals to: 0, if i is even; H, if i is odd. X0 equals to 0; Xi < Xi + 1 for 0 ? i < N - 1; XN - 1 equals to W. Your task is pretty simple: calculate the area of R, which is lying under P. Lets consider a small example for your better understanding: Lets define H = 4, W = 6, N = 3, X0 = 0, X1 = 5, X2 = 6. In this testcase we are interested in caculating the area of the green triangle.

They have played almost all games and seen all the attractions. But theres one game left which has caught their attention. The winner of this game could get a LOT of candies! The game is as follows: The game is a two-player game which is played on an NxM grid. Each cell of the grid has a certain number of candies. A[i][j] denotes the number of candies in the jth column of the ith row. The players make alternate turns. In each turn, a player must remove one complete row or one complete column from the grid. He will add all the candies in that row/column into his account. The only possible rows that a player can remove in his/her turn are the top row or the bottom row. Similarly, only leftmost column or the rightmost column can be removed in one turn. After removing the row or column, the game is played on the new reduced grid with one less row or column respectively. When the entire matrix is emptied, the player with higher number of candies wins the game and can take all those candies with him/her. The loser has to give back the candies collected so far and return empty-handed. If both players have equal number of candies, both of them are declared winners. Alice and Bob want to take as many candies home as possible. They dont have much time with themselves. So they come up with a strategy using which they want to increase Bobs share of candies and decrease Alices share. This way, they plan to make Bob win and take his entire share of candies! The strategy is as follows: Alice decides to pick the row or column from the present grid which has the least number of candies in every turn of hers. If there are more than one such options, then her order of preference will be: 1) first row 2) last row 3) first column 4) last column. For example, if all these 4 rows/columns have the same number of candies, she will remove the first row in this turn. Bob chooses an optimal strategy through which he maximizes his share of candies in the end of the game. Note that Bobs strategy maximizes the number of his candies, not winners candies. Also note that Bob knows Alices strategy, of course, and he will take into account her strategy when he decides his move. Its quite evident that their strategy is not optimal. It might happen that Bob loses a game. And sometimes, both might win (with equal number of candies). Given the grid and the number of candies in each cell, your task is to tell them how many candies will the winner get if they play with this combined strategy.

Chef likes to play with trees a lot. This time, he has a rooted tree T consisting of N nodes labelled uniquely with the integers from {1, … N}. The node labelled 1 is the root of the tree. Each node in the given tree T stores a non-negative integer, initially all of which are zeros. Chef wants to perform 2 types of operations over the tree accurately and efficiently. U X K: Update the subtree rooted at node X such that the the root X will have FK (the Kth Fibonacci number) added to it, all its children will have Fk+1 (the (K+1)th Fibonacci number) added to them, and so on. More formally, any node in the subtree rooted at X will have (K+D)th fibonacci number added to them, where D is the distance of the node from X. Q X: Report the value stored at the node X. Since the answer to each query can be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7. NOTE: FK denotes the Kth Fibonacci number, and the series is generated as follows: FK = 1, if K ? 2 .

In some of these cases, the cook cannot leave their workstation to get the tool because they have to closely watch their food. In such cases, the Chef simply fetches the tool for the cook. Unfortunately, many different cooks have simultaneously requested a tool they cannot reach. Thankfully, no two cooks requested the same tool. Nobody else is available to help the Chef so he has to deliver all of the tools himself. He has to plan a trip around the kitchen in such a way that he picks up each tool and delivers it to the requesting cook. Since the Chef has two hands, he may carry up to two tools at once.

This year they selected Nancy and took her with them to play the famous Zeta-Nim game. Given N piles of stones and a value K, each pile i has a counter Ci which is the maximum number of stones that can be removed from it. Initially, Ci = K for 0 <= i < N. Each turn involves selecting one of the N piles, say pile i, and removing R ( 1 <= R <= Ci ) stones from it and updating Ci = R. In other words, the number of stones removed from a pile should not be more than the number of stones removed from the same pile before, starting with removal of at most K stones. Zeta and Nancy take turns alternately and the one who can not remove any more stones lose.

Its guaranteed that this point will not be in S. - N - remove a point that was added during the Nth adding query from S. All of the adding queries are numbered in the order of their appearance starting from 1 (queries of other types are not included). Its guaranteed that this point is in S. ? X Y - calculate the maximal Manhattan distance between a point P with coordinates (X, Y) and any point from S. Its guaranteed that S will not be empty. In addition, you wont be given the exact query data, but instead should decode it in the following way: Lets store the result of the last processed query of the third type in a variable called ANSWER. Initially, ANSWER is equal to 0. You will be given X, Y and N instead of the real values of X, Y and N. To get the real data you should perform the following computations: X = X xor ANSWER; Y = Y xor ANSWER; N = N xor ANSWER. Dont forget to update the value of ANSWER after processing each query of the third type. Note Maybe some of you arent familiar with some terms in the statement.

Groups of tourists often want to go for a walk to pick some berries. For the i-th group it is known that it consists of Ki people and they will collect all the berries, from Ki consecutive bushes, beginning from the Li-th, going to the Li+1-th, the Li+2-th and so on.

Fair division is a division in such a way, that the difference between the maximal and the minimal number of berries a single tourist from the group receives is less than two. All the berries (even from a single bush) are different. Generally, there are a lot of ways to divide them fairly. For example, you can divide fairly two berries between two tourists in two ways. Some tourists are fond of dividing the berries. So, they will get upset if the number of ways to divide them is too small. But some tourists will get upset if the number of ways if too huge, they will find it quite confusing. So, the ChefLand tourist agency has offered the following service: for each group of tourists they tell the number of ways to divide the berries fairly among them after the walk. As they currently dont have enough employees, theyve asked you to help them. Of course, the number of berries on bushes changes during a day. Youll receive this information.

Situation is getting out of control! All buildings in Bytetown stand on straight line. The buildings are numbered 0, 1, ..., N?1 from left to right. Every hour one shake occurs. Each shake has 3 parameters: the leftmost building that was damaged during this shake, the corresponding rightmost building, and the force of the shake. Each time all the buildings in the disaster area are damaged equally. Lets consider this process in details. At any moment every building has the number that indicates its height (may have leading zeroes). This number corresponds to some string consisting of digits. When some shake affects to the building its string circularly rotates to the left by the value of the force of the shake and its height corresponds to the value of new string. Pay attention that after rotation string may have leading zeroes. For instance: a building with height 950 got in disaster area with force 2, Then its string become 095, so height in reality is 95. If it was one more shake with force 1, then its height would become 950 again. Major of Bytetown got some ideas how to protect residents, so sometimes he needs such kind of stats: find height of the highest building on some interval. You are given information about all the heights before the very first shake and then you get queries of two types: Type 0, described by 0 Li Ri Fi: Shake occurred on interval [Li, Ri] with force Fi.

The Aaugld alphabet consists of M letters, which well denote by integers from 1 to M in alphabetical order - the smaller number a letter has, the earlier it appears in the alphabet. Since the author of this alphabet wasnt very creative, many letters can be transformed to other ones using some simple operations, which well call inversions. Youre given a list of possible operations. The list isnt exhaustive, since any two inversions can be combined to produce a new inversion. Specifically, if there is an inversion that transforms a letter x to a letter y and an inversion that transforms the letter y to a letter z, you may assume that theres also an inversion that transforms the letter x to the letter z. In short, inversion operations are transitive. Combining any inversion with itself produces identity - an operation that transforms any letter to itself.

Therefore, if theres an inversion that transforms a letter x to a letter y, then theres also an inversion that transforms the letter y to the letter x. Theres a long word W with N letters.

They were known to be really strong and they did not have any war strategy. They would just attack the enemy randomly and overpower them with sheer number of soldiers. However, we all know that Baahubali and Bhallaladeva defeated the Kalakeyas by following the Thrishul strategy, and successfully defended their kingdom Maahishmati. We also know that Baahubali was very smart, and the truth is that he predicted how the Kalakeyas would attack and devised a counter strategy for the same, the night before the war. This is what he found: The Kalakeyas had N forts, numbered 1 to N and Baahubali had N soldiers, numbered 1 to N. Baahubali discovered that he can permute his soldiers in any way to get a permutation of 1 to N => P1, P2, ..., PN. He would then send his soldiers to attack the forts in the following way: soldier P1 attacks fort 1, soldier P2 attacks fort 2, ..., soldier PN attacks fort N. It is easy to note that each soldier attacks exactly one fort and no two soldiers attack the same fort. Baahubali also got to know about a secret key of the Kalakeyas, which is an integer K.

This is a midnight question of biological scientists. The number of pairs of different characters in the same position may be a good indicator. However, it will not work well in the case when two strings have different lengths. The longest common subsequence will also fail when strings are too long. Recently, Professor of Math L.P.C. has invented the special method to deal with this problem. His invention has been known as a simple but creative solution: the difference is based on the number of substrings (a non-empty group of consecutive characters) of one string that are not substrings of the other string. Lets learn about his invention. Call the first string as A and the second string as B. Let S be the set of all different substrings of A, and T be the set of all different substrings of B. We then define another set P which consists of all the strings that belongs to S or T, but not both. According to the Professor L.P.C. method, the size of P is a good indicator to measure the difference between A and B. For example, let A = aacd and B = cdaa. We can see that: S = {a, aa, aac, aacd, ac, acd, c, cd, d}, T = {c, cd, cda, cdaa, d, da, daa, a, aa}, P = {aac, aacd, ac, acd, cda, cdaa, da, daa}.

Chef has a binary tree. The binary tree consists of 1 or more nodes. Each node has a unique integer id. Each node has up to 2 children, which are identified by their ids, and each node is the child of at most 1 other node. A node X is considered to be an ancestor of node Y if node Y is a child of node X or if there is some node Z for which X is an ancestor of Z and Y is a child of Z. No node is an ancestor of itself. A special node called the root node is an ancestor of all other nodes. X Y Y X Z X Z Y Z Chef has forgotten which node of his tree is the root, and wants you to help him to figure it out. Unfortunately, Chefs knowledge of the tree is incomplete. He does not remember the ids of the children of each node, but only remembers the sum of the ids of the children of each node. Input Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case begins with an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.

The circumference of the front wheel is n (the same as the number of cities) yet the circumference of its rear wheel is only n - 1. We think of the circumference of each wheel as being broken up into equal-spaced positions. So the front wheel has positions 0, 1, ..., n-1 and the rear wheel has positions 0, 1, ..., n-2. Each unit of distance travelled will advance each wheel 1 position. For example, when the chef travels a distance of d when both wheels start at position 0, the position of the front wheel is left at d (mod n) and the position of the rear wheel is left at d (mod (n - 1)). Furthermore, the chef bikes very fast and the roads are very bumpy. Quite frequently at least one wheel is not touching the ground. When this happens, the wheel does not turn at all (the bike needs some lubrication). So the front and rear wheel may not even rotate the same total number of positions when travelling along a road. For each road i, we are given the start city s[i], the end city e[i], the distance the front wheel travels f[i], and the distance of the rear wheel r[i].

It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. In light of these events, Chef, the leader of the rebel alliance, wants to build safe connections in galaxy with N stars. There are M bidirectional space roads in space that connect pairs of stars together. Travelling through one space road takes 1 day. To avoid detection by the Empire, Chef decided that rebels must never travel alone. Instead, they must travel using armored rebel spaceships. Each spaceship is designated two stars, and a fixed route between these stars. A route is just a path composed of roads that connects two stars, but to increase security, Chef added the following restrictions on routes: Each route must be traversable within at most K days. Roads may be traversed any number times in a single route, in both directions.  After some time has passed, Chef and his engineers were able to build a spaceship for every possible route between stars. Unfortunately, the powerful Empire discovered this and plans to destroy these spaceships to maintain control of the galaxy. Specifically, they deployed a new superweapon called the Death Starkiller Base, which is able to destroy X spaceships at once! It works by analyzing all spaceships that pass through Empire-controlled star systems. Unfortunately, since the destruction of the Empires two previous superweapons, the budget for the new superweapon is crippled, so the Death Starkiller Base has some severe restrictions: It can only destroy exactly X spaceships per usage. Not more, not less. It can only destroy a group of spaceships if they travel between the same pair of stars.

Once the agent parachutes down that point, he then deploys in his exact location a special weapon called the pulverizer, which is designed to destroy walls.

The experiment involves a certain number of different liquid chemical substances which have been mixed together and are currently reacting with each other. There are n different types of liquid substances. However, each substance appears in k different variants called isomers, and Johnny cannot distinguish between the different isomers... We can assume that time is discrete and measured in minutes. During each minute, each possible reaction is described as follows: a b ratio type, meaning that ratio of liquid a (i.e., part of total amount, no matter which isomer) transforms into liquid b. If the reaction type is normal, then isomer i of liquid a transforms into isomer i of liquid b. If reaction type is special, then isomer i transforms into isomer i+1. At time 0, each substance is in its initial isomer form, having number 1. For the special threshold value k, once isomer k of any substance passes through a special reaction, it transforms into solid state matter and precipitates from the mixure, no longer taking part in reactions (so, for all practical purposes, we can say it disappears). Moreover, during each minute, a small part of each liquid disappears (transforms into gaseous state and evaporates). From Johnnys point of view, the evaporation happens just before the reactions in any given minute.

A spanning tree of an undirected, connected graph (V,E) with vertex set V and edge set E is a subset of edges F such that the graph (V,F) is connected and has no cycles. After a few moments thought, one realizes that an equivalent way to say this is to say: 1) |F| = |V| - 1 2) For any non-empty subset of nodes S, the number of edges with both endpoints in S is does not exceed |S|-1. There is a fairly simple algorithm that can determine if a set of edges F is indeed a spanning tree of a graph. Simply check that |F| = |V| - 1 and that the graph (V,F) is connected using your favorite connectivity algorithm. As in all topics in mathematics, the next step is to generalize what is known. So, consider the following generalization of spanning trees. Say a generalized spanning tree (GST) of a graph (V,E) is a function f from the set of edges E = {e1, e2, ..., eM} to the real interval [0,1] such that the following conditions hold: 1) f(e1) + f(e2) + ... + f(eM) = |V| - 1 2) For any non-empty subset of nodes S, the sum of the f(e) values for edges e with both endpoints in S does not exceed |S|-1. One can see that this generalizes the notion of a spanning tree since spanning trees (in the classical sense) correspond to GSTs by setting f(e) = 1 if e is in the spanning tree and f(e) = 0 if e is not in the spanning tree.

Still, if a server A wants to communicate with another server B but their devices dont communicate directly, then server A may ask relay their request to server B using intermediate devices/servers. There are two additional complications. First, the Chef is worried that relaying requests using intermediate servers may get confusing. Thus, for any two servers who can communicate, either directly or indirectly through other servers, there should be a unique way to pass messages between these servers. Second, each pair of devices that can communicate directly does so over a specified frequency. However, if too many pairs of devices communicate over the same frequency, then the messages may be corrupted. Because of these two problems, the Chef has ordered that some pairs of devices be forbidden to communicate. This may result in some pairs of servers who could communicate before to be unable to communicate, but the Chef thinks this negative effect is outweighed by the guarantee that the above problems dont occur. Your goal is to determine the maximum number of pairs of devices that may be allowed to communicate directly without having to go through intermediate devices.

Given a graph G on nodes V with undirected edges E, an independent set X is a subset of V such that no edge in E has both endpoints in X. Finding the size of the largest independent set in a graph is currently a very difficult problem. Consider the following generalization of an independent set. A function f that maps each node v to a non-negative value f(v) is said to be a partially generalized independent set if, for any edge e = (u,v), we have f(u) + f(v) ? 1. Unfortunately, this doesnt provide a great generalization. Consider a graph G where every possible edge exists in E. The size of a maximum independent set is only 1 whereas assigning 1/2 to every value f(v) has the total fractional value of the f(v) values being |V|/2. So, lets add one more constraint to strengthen the notion of a generalized independent set. A cycle in a graph is a sequence of k ? 2 distinct nodes v1, v2, ..., vk where there is an edge between vi and vi+1 for any 1 ? i < k as well as an edge between v1 and vk. Notice that cycles of length 2 (i.e. edges) are permitted by this definition. If C is a cycle of G of length |C|, then no independent set can have more than floor(|C|/2) nodes from C. Given this, define a generalized independent set as a function f on nodes in V that satisfies the following conditions. For any cycle C = v1, v2, ..., v|C|, we have f(v1) + f(v2) + ... + f(v|C|) ? floor(|C|/2). Finally, for each node v we must have 0 ? f(v) ? 1.

Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much. Since Tomya has completed collecting the stamps in Ciels restaurant, she now challenges the bonus game in her restaurant.

And Tomyas aim in this game is to get many coins at the end of the game. This game will run as follows. Tomya chooses a color, and Tomya bets some coins (suppose x coins are bet) on the color. Here x must be non-negative integer at most L, and Tomya must have x coins before betting. Then Ciel chooses a ball from the box, checks its color and discards the ball. If the ball has the same color as Tomyas bet, then Tomya gets B·x coins, otherwise Tomya must pay x coins. Note that, if Tomya wins, then she receives back her bet as well as B·x coins.

Since he made his fortune on the network of pizza parloursa), he has been giving expensive gifts to the members of the family every Christmas. Receiving the gift, however, always involves solving a more or less fancy mathematical puzzle. This year, your gift was locked in a safe, self-made by your grandfather.

After two unsuccessful attempts the content will be annihilated! Then how am I supposed to solve this, Grandpa? - you asked. Go and have a better look at the package - grandfather replied. Indeed, at the bottom of the package you found a city map on which were indicated all the pizza parlours belonging to your grandfather, as well as a long sheet of paper with a sequence of positive integers. After analysing the data for a while you realized that the number of integer values is equal to the number of pizza restaurants... Recognizing that you still have too little input, you went to ask grandfather for further guidance. Ah, all right, Ill solve the riddle for you - grandfather relented. For each pizza parlour you have to draw such an axis-aligned square that it is centered at the restaurant and half of the length of its side is equal to the corresponding value from the sheet. Then you have to count all the streets on the map which intersect with the square, and write down the result of calculations. The result for the last pizza parlour will be your magic number. You were a bit surprised that grandfather ordered you to draw squares and count streets for all the restaurants (and there were many), since the code would only depend on the last one. Nonetheless you willingly took on the job, drew the square for the last pizza parlour, counted the streets and entered the number. Unfortunately the safe didnt open. You rushed to grandfather and told him about the first failed attempt. Oh dear, did I forget to mention? - the old man was slightly taken aback.

Byteland is a strange country, with many cities, but with a poorly developed road network (in fact, there is exactly one route from each city to any other city, possibly leading through other cities). Until recently, the cities of Byteland were independently governed by proud Mayors, who chose not to integrate too tightly with their neighbours. However, recent opinion polls among Bytelandian computer programmers have shown a number of disturbing trends, including a sudden drop in pizza consumption. Since this had never before happened in Byteland and seemed quite inexplicable, the Mayors sought guidance of the High Council of Wise Men of Byteland. After a long period of deliberation, the Council ruled that the situation was very serious indeed: the economy was in for a long-term depression! Moreover, they claimed that tighter integration was the only way for the Bytelandian cities to survive. Whether they like it or not, the Mayors must now find a way to unite their cities as quickly as possible.

This way, any stronghold not in S is ‘threatened’ by a stronghold in S. 2.S can properly defend (defined next) any attack from strongholds outside of S. The mechanism for attacking and defending S is defined as follows: i.In an attack, each single stronghold y not belonging to S will select one of its neighbor z belonging to S (if any) to attack. In this case y is an attacker of z. ii.Given the attack routes of all y not belonging to S, each stronghold x belonging to S may decide to defend one of its neighbors, say z, in which case x is a defender of z. Alternatively, x may decide to defend itself, in which case x is a defender of x. iii.The attack can be properly defended if there exists a defend route such that at every stronghold z belonging to S, there are at least as many defenders of z as attackers of z. The rationale is that once the Chef occupies the strongholds in S, any other stronghold is immediately within reach of S by a single road (rule 1), and S will never be overwhelmed by attacks from outside (rule 2), and thus the Chef will never lose a stronghold in S.

Cooks are labeled from 1 to N. ks neighbors are (k-1) and (k+1), as they are standing in a circle. Note that if k = 1, k-1 wraps around to N; and if k = N, k+1 wraps around to 1. Let A[i] represent the integer that is kept by the cook i. The game proceeds in turns. In each turn, any one cook may opt to play. Now, suppose the cook k wants to play in this turn, the following changes happen, in the given order: A[k-1] = A[k-1] + A[k] A[k+1] = A[k+1] + A[k] A[k] = -A[k] The game would end as soon as all the numbers kept by the cooks (each A[i]) is non-negative. Cooks are very impatient people! They want to end the game as quickly as possible!

Code and Chef play a game on the set of all points with positive integer coordinates of the usual coordinate plane. Initially the lame queen stands in the point with coordinates (x0, y0) or shortly: in the point (x0, y0). Players alternate moves. Code moves first. During each move the player can move the queen from the point (x, y) to the point (x - a, y), (x, y - a) or (x - a, y - a) for some positive integer a, provided that the new point has positive coordinates. But since the queen is lame she possibly cant make all diagonal moves. Namely she can move from the point (x, y) to the point (x - a, y - a) only if a is divisible by d, where d is some positive integer that is called the queen lameness. So if d = 2 the queen can move diagonally from the point (x, y) only to the points (x - 2, y - 2), (x - 4, y - 4), (x - 6, y - 6) and so on. However if d = 1 then the queen becomes the usual chess queen. The first player who cant make a valid move loses the game. Both players play optimally in their respective moves.  After playing this game for some time Chef realizes that he loses almost always. Now he wants to know what is the probability that he wins if initial point (x0, y0) is chosen randomly from the rectangle x1 <= x0 <= x2, y1 <= y0 <= y2.

You are given a set of N two-dimensional non-zero vectors (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), ..., (XN, YN) with integer coordinates. You can choose no more than 6 vectors from this set to form a non-strictly convex polygon that have sides equal to these vectors (see paragraph below for more detailed explanation). Non-strictly convex polygon is the polygon that can have flat angles (angles of 180 degrees). You can select each vector several times if needed. Your goal is to maximize the area of this polygon. It is guaranteed that at least one such convex polygon can be constructed. How exactly we construct a polygon from the given sequence of vectors? Suppose youve chosen the sequence of vectors (U1, V1), (U2, V2), ..., (UK, VK), where 3 ? K ? 6. Each vector here should be equal to one of the given N vectors but some vectors in this sequence can coincide. At first, you take some point (A1, B1) at the plane as the first vertex of your polygon. Then you put your first vector (U1, V1) to this point to obtain the second vertex (A2, B2) = (A1 + U1, B1 + V1). Next you take the second vector and put it to the second vertex to obtain the third vertex and so on. Finally, at the last step you put vector (UK, VK) to the Kth vertex (AK, BK) to obtain the point (AK + 1, BK + 1) = (AK + UK, BK + VK) that should coincide with the first vertex (A1, B1), otherwise we should reject this sequence of vectors. Hence in the end we obtain a polygon with vertexes (A1, B1), (A2, B2), ..., (AK, BK). If this polygon is simple (without self-intersections) and non-strictly convex, we should consider its area as the candidate for the answer.

(600, 'CPP', 'https://www.codechef.com/problems/CPP', 'All submissions for this problem are available. Chefs restaurants are under attack. His competitors in disguise of customers or employees visit his restaurants and create trouble. Chef is extremely agitated. When he calms down he decides to beef up security. The plan is codenamed Chef Protection Plan. Under this plan, everything is checked before being entered into restaurants. After much thinking it was decided to check for identification numbers of cooks, customers, delivery van etc. Various types of identification numbers to be checked are : Security number, Employee number, Roll number etc. Chef has restaurants all over the world. Different places have different formats for a given identification number and there are too many types of identification numbers. Thus Chef needs to specify the format for all the identification numbers in a convenient way. The format should also be consistent because the code monkeys who will be automating the process are not very careful with specifications. An identification number is composed of uppercase letters and digits and hyphen (-) only. Thus instead of calling it an identification number, we will call it an ID string henceforth. The rules used by Chef for specifying a format of an ID string are (formats are underlined)- A portion of string can be a fixed string, i.e. matches itself exactly only. Like XYZ, A321, D-409 etc. The specification contains keywords in lowercase to describe the ID string. This is the list of keywords, along with their meaning- - to : is used for specifying a range from a letter to letter or a digit to digit. Like 3 to 8, D to Z etc. Note that ranges of numbers cannot be specified using to. 1 to 1000 is invalid because 1000 is not a digit but a number. Also D to A is invalid because the left-hand-side should not be greater than the right-hand-side. - or : is used to specify a list of exclusive options. Like XYZ or Y2K, 1 or 3 or 55 etc. - times : is used to specify the number of times (N) a portion of the format string is to be repeated. Like A 3 times, S01 12 times etc. The first example can also be specified simply as AAA instead. Thus as you will see there are multiple ways to specify same type of ID strings. Also the portion (to be repeated) is smallest meaningful expression. Like in A B 2 times, B is repeated 2 times and not AB. - optional : is used to specify that the string portion is optional, i.e can be present or absent. Like LP optional, 12KL optional etc. Also the portion (to be made optional) is smallest meaningful expression. Like in A B optional, B is optional and not AB. - digit : is used to specify any digit. It is same as writing 0 to 9 or 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 in the rule. - letter : is used to specify any letter. It is same as writing A to Z or A or B or C... in the rule. - digits : is used to specify the number of times any digit may be repeated. It can be specified in two ways- -- exactly N digits, where N is an integer. Like exactly 3 digits matches 007 and 987 but not 5 or 42 -- upto N digits, where N is an integer. Like upto 3 digits matches 7, 42 and 987 but not 4444. This rule can also match 0 digits. See the examples below. - letters : is used to specify the number of times any letter may be repeated. It can be specified in two ways- -- exactly N letters, where N is an integer. Like exactly 3 letters matches ABC and CPP but not Z or VG -- upto N letters, where N is an integer. Like upto 3 letters matches A, BC and DEF but not PQRS. This rule can also match 0 letters. The above keywords can be used to describe a portion of the format string. By writing such sub-formats side by side we can describe entire ID string. Like 3 to 8 XYZ or Y2K matches 4XYZ, 7Y2K etc. but not XYZ, Y2K5 etc. The sub-formats can be nested as well. Like 3 to 8 or Y2K, digit 2 times. Notice that second example is equivalent to exactly 2 digits. Parentheses can be used to enforce grouping in formats or to provide clarity. Like XYZ 12 or 34 optional makes 34 optional. Instead if you want 12 or 34 to be optional, you can use parentheses : XYZ (12 or 34) optional. Parenthesis can also be used when they are not really required. Like ((XYZ)) 234 is equivalent to XYZ 234, which can also be written as XYZ234. Note that () is invalid, because Chef believes empty parenthesis are useless. Spaces are used to separate keywords, strings, numbers, digits and letters from each other. Like ABCoptional is invalid, but ABC optional is valid. Spaces are very useful in breaking apart strings, like AB CD 2 times. Parenthesis can also be used for separation, like AB(CD)2 times is same as the last format. But A(to)B is invalid as parenthesis enforce grouping as well and (to) alone is invalid.             Now Chef is lousy at writing formats. Like he can add unnecessary spaces around words. He wont add stray symbols though. Also being a human he can sometimes end up writing erroneous formats -- the ones which do not conform to his rules. Like optional ABC, 1 to A etc. are invalid formats. But he would never use symbols apart from lowercase/uppercase letter, digits, parenthesis, hyphen(-) and space.', ' grammar-parsing hard may13 regex string-parsing v', '6', 'Constraints 1 ?

The chef was recently studying about repeated occurrences of substrings in the strings. In particular, he was studying about a string s. He calls a string to be in tandem if it can be represented as concatenation of three equal strings, i.e. it can be represented as AAA where A is a non-empty string. For brevity, he calls such strings tandem strings. For example, ababab is a tandem string whereas abab is not. Now, Chef is studying tandem substrings of string s. He calls a tandem substring an interesting tandem if the character following the substring in string s (if it exists) is different than the first character of the substring. If the character following the tandem substring does not exist (i.e. the substring appears as a suffix of string s), its also called interesting tandem. Chef calls all the tandem substrings which are not interesting tandem as boring tandems. Now, chef wants your help in counting number of interesting and boring tandem substrings in string s.

(618, 'CIELHACK', 'https://www.codechef.com/problems/CIELHACK', 'All submissions for this problem are available. Chef Ciel now faces a crisis situation. It is a really complicated situation, please read carefully. Here, your task is to calculate the minimum expected time for slipping out of the crisis situation. As you know, Ciel uses a safe having Box and Ball System as the combination of the safe (See NOTE 1). And, of course, Ciel now knows that the number of the valid combinations for the safe is really large, and it is hard to open it if she forgets her combination. Hence Ciel wrote the combination in a text file and split the text file into K pieces, where each piece is compressed with some password. That is, she needs passwords for all K pieces for checking the combination of her safe. Now Ciel has forgotten the combination for her safe and passwords for all K pieces! However she remembers that the password for the i-th piece is a positive integer not greater than Ni, that is, there are only Ni possibilities for the i-th pieces password. So shed like to try brute-force. Since her computer is too slow, Ciel decides to use computer centers in her town. There are C computer centers in all. Since Ciel is afraid of leaking the combination for her safe, Ciel will use exactly K distinct computer centers, one center for one piece. Currently Ciel is in her restaurant. Apparently her restaurant and all computer centers are located along one street. Hence we will consider Ciels restaurant and computer centers as points on a coordinate line. Lets assume that Ciels restaurant has coordinate 0 while the coordinate of the j-th computer center is Xj. So the distance between Ciels restaurant and the j-th computer center is |Xj| meters while the sign of Xj indicates in which direction of the street (positive or negative) Ciel should walk to this center. After Ciel will choose K different centers for cracking passwords of her K pieces she will visit them in some order, crack all the pieces (one piece at one computer center) and return back to her restaurant. At each computer center she should wait until the password for the current piece will be cracked and only then she can proceed to the next center. Ciels walking speed is V meters per nanosecond, so she needs exactly |A ? B| / V nanoseconds to walk from the point with coordinate A to the point with coordinate B. In the j-th computer center, Ciel can use grid computing with at most Pj computers. Each computer is really faster than Ciels one, it needs exactly Tj nanoseconds for checking one password. However computers are connected by really strange and bad network. So the step-by-step Ciels plan for cracking the piece is the following: Choose some set of computers (among available Pj computers) that will be involved in the cracking process. This takes no time. Copy the compressed piece (which she decided to crack in this center) and the program that will be used for cracking directly into one of the chosen computers. This also takes no time. Copy the piece and the program to all of the remaining computers by one of the scenarios that she may choose. The copying process will be made by network connection between computers and may take some time. However, if she chooses only one computer than this step should be omitted. Simultaneously run the cracking program on all of the chosen computers. Once one of the computers will crack the piece, save the password, terminate all the programs and delete all her information from all the computers. This takes no time since she will simply reboot and clear all the involved computers by the evil red button :) Now she can proceed to the next center or to the restaurant if this was the last piece. Now we describe in detail this plan. The cracking program description. The program that will be used for cracking proceeds as follows. At each step it chooses uniformly at random one of the valid passwords that was not chosen before and check this password (this takes exactly Tj nanoseconds). If the password is correct the program returns this password to the Ciel and terminates. Note that the computers cant connect to each other while this program is running at each of them. So it is possible that some passwords will be checked for several times at different computers. The network connection. As was mentioned, the computers will distribute the piece and the program through the network connection between them. Bluntly speaking each time each computer that has the piece and the program try to connect to some other computer that has not yet this information and copy it to this computer. This process finishes when all required by Ciel computers have the piece and the program. Since the network connection is weird the time needed for connecting some computer to another computer is random! Namely it has the exponential distribution with mean Sj (see wikipedia for details). So the average time for connection between two computers is Sj nanoseconds. But once connection between two computers is established some files or some data can be copied with no time. Note that computer can try to connect only to one other computer at the same time. However several computers can try to connect to the same computer and once one of them is connected all other computers will be immediately notified about this and stop the connection process with this computer. The connection scenario details. Ciel can control how the computers will try to connect to each other. Namely, for each computer she can provide a preferences list, that is, the order in which this particular computer will try to connect to other computers after it receives the piece and the program. Initially the computer that receives the piece and the program from Ciel will start the process. Consider some computer A that has already received the piece and the program. It considers computers in its list one by one. If the current computer B in its list has already the piece and the program then it will skipped. This check requires no time since it can be made by instant ping from A to B. Otherwise the computer A will try to connect to the computer B and once connected copy required information to it. After that the computer A will proceed to the next computer in its list. It is possible that some other computers are trying to connect to the computer B at the same time when A doing this. In this case the first computer that establishes the connection will copy the piece and the program to B while other computers stop the connection process with B and proceed to the next computers in their lists. Only when all required computers will have the piece and the program Ciel simultaneously execute the program in all of them. Some examples for cracking are in NOTE 2. So Ciel should choose the using computer center for each piece, choose the number of using computers and connection scenario in each computer center in order to minimize the expected needed total time to crack all the pieces and return back to her restaurant. NOTE 1. If youve never seen Box and Ball System, you may find it in BBSYSTEM. But it is not needed to understand Box and Ball System for solving this problem. NOTE 2. Consider the process of cracking the password with Ni = 3 by using 4 computers labeled by integers from 1 to 4. Let the correct password be 1, and wrong passwords be 2 and 3. Also since all computers are the same we may assume that Ciel will copy the piece and the program to the first computer and always choose the first several computers. Some of Ciels choices are the following: 1) Ciel uses only 1 computer. In this case the time for connections is not needed. The running time is Tj nanoseconds if the computer checks 1 at first (probability 1/3). The running time is 2 * Tj nanoseconds if the computer checks passwords in order (2, 1) or (3, 1) (probability 1/3). The running time is 3 * Tj nanoseconds if the computer checks passwords in order (2, 3, 1) or (3, 2, 1) (probability 1/3). The expected needed time is Tj * (1/3) + 2 * Tj * (1/3) + 3 * Tj * (1/3) = 2 * Tj nanoseconds. 2) Ciel uses 2 computers. Then there is only one scenario of how the piece and the program will be distributed among the computers: computer 1 will send the program and the piece to the computer 2. The expected time for this is Sj nanoseconds. The expected running time of the cracking program is more complicated to calculate. For example, the running time will be Tj nanoseconds if the pair of the first checked passwords by the computers is one of (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), where the first elements is checked by the computer 1, and second is checked the computer 2. The running time may be 2 * Tj or 3 * Tj nanoseconds in many cases. 3) Ciel uses 3 computers. In this case several preferences lists choices are available. For example, one of such choices can be represented as {(2, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1)}. Here (2, 3) is the preference list of computer 1, (1, 3) is the preference list of computer 2 and (2, 1) is the preference list of computer 3. For this scenario at first computer 1 will send the piece and the program to computer 2. And then both computers 1 and 2 will try to connect to computer 3. If, for example, computer 2 will be connected to computer 3 at first then it copy the required information while the computer 1s trial will be canceled immediately. Then 3 computers may run the brute-force program. Here the expected time is secret. Please calculate by yourself. 4) Ciel uses 4 computers. Here we consider two examples of how preferences lists can be chosen. 4.1) The lists are {(2, 3, 4), (1, 3, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 3)}. Here computer 1 sends the piece and the program to computer 2 at first. Then both computers 1 and 2 will try to connect to computer 3 and first connected computer will copy the required information, while other computers trial will be canceled. Finally all 3 computers 1, 2 and 3 will try to connect to computer 4 and first connected computer will copy the required information, while other computers trials will be canceled. 4.2) The lists are {(2, 3, 4), (1, 4, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 3)}. Here computer 1 sends the piece and the program to computer 2 at first. Then computer 1 will try to connect to computer 3, while computer 2 will try to connect to computer 4. Assume that computer 1 will establish the connection earlier than computer 2. Then computer 1 will copy the required information to computer 3 and both computers 1 and 3 will try to connect to computer 4. Note that computer 2 is still trying to connect to computer 4. So we will have all 3 computers trying to connect to computer 4 at the same time. Though computer 2 started this process earlier, any computer among 1, 2, 3 can be the first connected to computer 4 with some probability. As before the first connected computer will copy the required information, while other computers trials will be canceled.', ' dp hard laycurse oct12', '4', 'Constraints 1 ?

A galaxy is a set of planets with some connections between pairs of planets. Connections between planets are mutual and no planet can be connected with itself. The distance between a pair of planets is the least number of connections that you have to pass through while travelling from the first planet to the second. Now lets consider how good galaxies are formed. Initially there is a galaxy that consists of exactly one planet. At any moment, the galaxy grows by first making a copy of itself; then connecting each planet in the first copy to the corresponding planet in the second copy. Thus a galaxy which has P planets and M connections would grow into a new galaxy with 2P planets and 2M+P connections. This diagram shows how the galaxy grows over the first two iterations. Dark grey shows the copy of the galaxy; light grey shows the additional connections. However, galaxies do not continue growing forever. Why? The answer is simple: comets. At any point after the galaxy has started growing, a comet may pass through the galaxy. When it does, it changes the connections between planets by the following rule: Two planets are connected after the comet arrives if and only if the distance between the planets was equal to 2 before the comet arrives. It can be shown that a comet will split a growing galaxy into two disconnected galaxies with identical structures. After a comet has arrived, the galaxy stops growing. Researchers have discovered that each of the two identical galaxies formed by the comet are good galaxies - fit for living. In fact, galaxies formed in this way are the only good galaxies that exist. This diagram shows the result when a comet arrives after each of the first three iterations. In each one the red and blue colours show the two equivalent good galaxies. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever. For many reasons, such as a second comet appearing, new planets or connections between them may be created or destroyed, resulting in galaxies with many other structures and causing the galaxy to lose its good status. You are given a galaxy with N planets and M connections. Your task is to determine whether this galaxy is a good galaxy - ie can be created by a comet passing through a growing galaxy.', ' dec14 graph hard pavel1996', '4', 'Constraints 1 ? T ? 5 2 ?

Let S = s1, s2, ...,sn be a string and let S[i, j] denote the substring si, si+1, ... sj. The suffix array A of S is an array of integers giving the starting positions of suffixes of S in lexicographical order. This means, the entry A[i] contains the starting position of the i-th smallest(lexicographically) suffix of S. In other words, for all 1 < i ? n: S[A[i - 1], n] < S[A[i], n]. Let us take an example. Suppose S = 12323. Then all suffixes of S are 12323, 2323, 323, 23, 3. If we sort the suffixes lexicographically, we get 12323, 23, 2323, 3, 323. Therefore the suffix array, which gives the starting positions of suffixes in lexicographic order, will be A = 1, 4, 2, 5, 3. There is exactly one suffix array for each string. However, several strings can give the same suffix array. In this problem, given a suffix array A of length N, you have to calculate the number of strings S whose suffix array is A. However, N can be very large, so the array A is not given directly. You should initialize the array A as A[i] = i for all 1 ? i ? N and apply M operations to it in order to obtain the desired suffix array A. Each operation can be of one of the following types: 0 u v: Remove the sub-sequence A[u,v] and bring it to the front. After this operation, the N elements would be in the following order: A[u], A[u + 1], ... A[v], A[1], A[2], ... A[u - 1], A[v + 1], A[v + 2], ... A[N]. 1 u v: Flip A[u,v]. After this operation, the N elements would be in the following order: A[1], A[2], ... A[u-1], A[v], A[v-1], ... A[u+1], A[u], A[v+1], A[v+2], ... A[N]. For this problem, a string is an array of positive integers. Additionally, the number of different integers used in a string must be same as the largest integer in the string. For example: (1, 2, 2) and (4, 5, 1, 2, 3) are valid strings while (1, 1, 3) and (-1, 0, 1, 2) are not.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. A single pawn is placed on a grid. The grid consists of cells (X, Y) for non-negative integers X and Y. Some cells of the grid have been marked as impassable. A move consists of choosing some positive integer D and moving the pawn from (X, Y) either to (X ? D, Y) or to (X, Y ? D), of course, if this cell belongs to the grid. In other words, we move the pawn a positive number of steps along the row or column towards the origin. The pawn is not allowed to land on nor pass through an impassable cell.

He got lost in a Chess Kingdom where the chess pieces lived together on a huge chess board. In that dream, the Chef met the King and asked him for help. Unfortunately, The King really admired the cooking skills of the Chef and wanted The Chef to cook for him every day. The King gave the Chef a task and said that the Chef could leave only after solving it. The task of the King required a lot of calculations and The Chef thought he would have to stay in the Chess Kingdom forever. Hopefully, the Chef woke up and realized that it was just a dream. No! Actually, it was a nightmare. The Chef could not sleep in the rest of the night, worrying that he might meet the King again. Thus, the Chef really needs your help to finish the task of the King. The task that the King gave to the Chef is described as follows. The Chess Kingdom is a N × N chess board. The rows are numbered by integers from 1 to N, inclusive, from the top to the bottom. Similarly, the columns are numbered by integers from 1 to N, inclusive, from the left to the right. The cell at the intersection of the row i and the column j is denoted as cell (i, j). The Chess Kingdom is guarded by K bishops standing at K different cells of the board. Additionally, There are M other chess pieces standing on M different cells on the board. The bishop can move any number of squares (maybe zero) diagonally, but can not leap over other pieces. In other words, a bishop at the cell (a, b) can move to the cell (u, v) if we can pick the vector (x, y) in the set {(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)} so that u = a + t * x and v = b + t * y for some positive integer t and all the cells of the form (a + i * x, b + i * y) in which 1 ? i ? t are empty.

After thinking about the problem for some time, he has invented the following algorithm: for each number in the permutation, if it is located to the right of its correct position in sorted sequence, add to the output value the distance between this two positions. Formally, Lukass answer is given as: Sum ( max {0, i-pi[i]} ), where pi[i] i s the i-the element of the permutation .

Let LC(N) be the largest Cool Number which is not greater than N, and UC(N) be the smallest Cool Number which is greater than N. So the following inequalities hold LC(N) ? N < UC(N). Your task is to find for the given positive integer N the values of LC(N) and UC(N). As you will see from the examples LC(N) and UC(N) exist for every positive integer N. Consider some examples. 1458 is a Cool Number since ((1 + 4 + 5 + 8) – (1 + 5))1 + 5 = 126 = 2985984 is divisible by 1458. Note that here we select two digits: 1 and 5.

Dragonstone is the name of the island located at the entrance to Blackwater Bay and the castle thereon, which was shaped from stone to look like dragons. Dragonstone was the original seat of House Targaryen in Westeros, which they had colonized and fortified as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold. (c) A Wiki of Ice and Fire After Roberts Rebellion(also known as the War of the Usurper), the island passed to Stannis Baratheon, who became the Lord of Dragonstone. It turned out, that theres a lot of secret chambers hidden underground the castle. In this problem we assume, that the secret chambers can be described as N points on the Cartesian plane, both coordinates of which are integers. The points are indexed with integers from 1 to N. Theres a bidirected passage between any pair of the chambers. Lets consider two chambers A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2). Then it takes |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| minutes to travel through the passage, that connects chambers A and B. The passages are extremely dark, so it isnt safe to travel through them without a lantern. Stannis Baratheon has a very special lantern, which hes planning to use during the next Q trips between the secret chambers. Lets consider a single trip: At first, Stannis chooses a chamber S - where hes starting the trip - and a chamber F - where hes finishing the trip. After that, he chooses an integer C, which is the capacity of the lantern for the current trip. Stannis can refill the oil in his lantern at any chamber, but not passage. It means, that he cannot walk passages, that take more than C minutes to travel through. If C is too small, then theres a chance that Stannis wont be able to travel from chamber S to chamber F. On other hand, if C is too large, then the lantern will be quite heavy and Stannis will be exhausted by the end of the trip. Your task is pretty simple: determine the minimal number C for each Stanniss trip, such that he will be able to travel from S to F.

One unavoidable problem with running a restaurant is that occasionally a menu item cannot be prepared. This can be caused by a variety of reasons such as missing ingredients or malfunctioning equipment. There is an additional problem with such situations. A customer who has spent many minutes deciding between menu items can get quite annoyed when they place the order and the server tells them the item is not available. To mitigate this effect, the Chef declares that all servers must have what he calls a backup function. This is a function f from menu items to menu items. For each menu item x, f(x) is an alternative menu item that the server may suggest to the customer in the event the customer requests menu item x when x is not available. Of course, if a given item is not available then some other items make better suggestions than others. So, for some pairs of items x and y the Chef has determined a numeric value describing the effectiveness of the assignment f(x) = y. Higher values indicate the proposed substitute is similar to the original and lower values indicate the proposed substitute is not very similar to the original. Such effectiveness values are symmetric meaning that if the effectiveness of assignment f(x) = y is v, then the effectiveness of the assignment f(y) = x is also v. You will be given a list of pairs of menu items. Each such pair will come with an associated effectiveness value. You are to compute a backup function f from these pairs. However, there is one additional constraint. For personal reasons, the Chef is opposed to using two items as backups for each other. Thus, for any two menu items x and y, it cannot be that f(x) = y and f(y) = x. Your goal is to compute a backup function of maximum possible quality. The quality of the backup function is simply defined as the sum of the effectiveness values of the assignments f(a) for each item a.', ' cook02 friggstad hard', '3', '', 'True', 'hard', ' cook02 friggstad hard', '5', '50000'),

Before a game starts, one player chooses a vertex of the graph and puts a checker (called the game checker) on it. Then the players take turns alternately. In a single turn, a player moves the game checker from its current vertex, say v, to some neighbour (see note) of v. The game goes on until one of the players surrenders.

Using suffix trees its often easy to solve the hardest computer science problems on strings.

Generally, the suffix tree is a tree whose edges are labeled with strings. Instead, well only consider suffix tries whose edges are labeled with single characters. This way every edge of a suffix tree may correspond to one or more edges connected in a chain-style fashion of a suffix trie. Another trait of suffix trees is that each suffix of the string for which the suffix tree is built corresponds to exactly one path from the trees root to a leaf. This is usually achieved by terminating each suffix of the string with a special character, say, $. However, in suffix tries we wont do that. In particular, this implies that the number of leaves in a suffix trie can be smaller than the length of the original string.

Short circuit evaluation of Boolean expressions denotes the semantic in which the second argument of some Boolean operator is not evaluated if the value of the first argument is enough to have the result. This technique is used in many programming languages to optimize the evaluation of Boolean expressions. Specifically for A and B, if A is false we know that the whole expression is false and we dont need to evaluate B. For A or B, if A is true we know the result to be true. Now having that those Boolean operations are commutative we may actually evaluate B first and not evaluate A in case B gives us the result. Moving the idea further if we have A1 or A2 or...or An we can evaluate the variables in any order and as soon as we have one of them as true we know that the whole expression is true. We can do similarly for and operation. Now lets consider some complex Boolean expression. We will fix the order in which we will evaluate the variables of the expression. Then we evaluate those variables in that order and we wont evaluate the variables that give us no new information about the value of the whole expression in the process. For example, assume we have A and B or C and we fix the order of evaluation B, A, C. First we evaluate B, if its false we dont have to evaluate A and only evaluate C. However if B is true we will need to evaluate A. If A is true we know the expression is true and wont evaluate C, otherwise we evaluate C to have the value of the expression.

People in Byteland are going to improve the transportation system in their own way. They have planned to build two straight roads. These roads will not necessary connect any cities but they should decrease the time of traveling between some cities. People can use a pathway to go from one city to the nearest point on the road. Then they can move [along the road] to the point of the road that is the nearest to their destination. And finally, they can use another pathway to move from that point to the destination. Let d be the distance from the city to the closest point that belongs to one of the roads, then the sadness of that city will be equal to d2. The sadness of the whole country is the average of the sadness of all cities. Can you help Byteland to find the plan that will minimize the sadness of the country? You can assume that: The cities are considered to be points on the plane and the roads are considered to be line segments. A road can have arbitrary length if that reduces the sadness of the country.

The price of a pizza is the summation of qualities of its ingredients. k j i Q[i, j, k] k (j1, j2) 1 2 i Q[i, j1, k] * Q[i, j2, k] 1 2 By the way, Cucumber Boy and Cucumber Girl live in the Wolf Town. Cucumber Boy and Cucumber Girl like pizza very much, but now they are bored by the existing pizzas, despite there are many kinds of pizzas. So they want to propose the collaboration between two distinct buildings (say i1 and i2). If their wish is realized, the pizza collaborated between shop j1 in building i1 and j2 in building i2 will be sold. The price of the pizza will be determined by the usual way, that is, the price will be the summation of Q[i1, j1, k] * Q[i2, j2, k] over 1 ? k ? N. Note that j1 = j2 is possible here. i1 1 i2 2 j1 1 i1 1 j2 2 i2 2  the summation of Q[i1, j1, k] * Q[i2, j2, k] over 1 ? k ? N Q[i1, j1, k] * Q[i2, j2, k] 1 1 2 2 1 ? k ? N  j1 1 j2 2 Now Cucumber Boy chooses two buildings i1 and i2 such that 1 ? i1 < i2 ? B. In each day Cucumber Boy and Cucumber Girl want to eat N collaborated pizzas. Here these N pizzas should satisfy the following conditions. i1 1 i2 2 1 i1 1 i2 2 B N N Each of N pizzas is a collaborated pizza between one shop in building i1 and one shop in building i2. Every shop in building i1 collaborates for one of N pizzas. Every shop in building i2 collaborates for one of N pizzas. Each of N pizzas is a collaborated pizza between one shop in building i1 and one shop in building i2. N i1 1 i2 2 Every shop in building i1 collaborates for one of N pizzas. i1 1 N Every shop in building i2 collaborates for one of N pizzas. i2 2 N Clearly, there are exactly N! (factorial of N) of such sets of N pizzas. Therefore, Cucumber Boy and Cucumber Girl will eat all distinct such sets during N! days eating each such set of pizzas exactly once and, of course, eating exactly one such set per day (see the first sample input for clarity). N! N N N! Cucumber Boy is a show-off, so he wants to pay more money than Cucumber Girl. But Cucumber Girl is a steadfast person, so she may disturb it. However if at least one of N pizzas has odd price (that is, the price not divisible by 2), she gives away him to pay more money than her in this day (otherwise, she pays the same amount of money as he pays). But the next time such situation occurs, she will pay more money than Cucumber Boy in this day. Namely, consider all days for which we have at least one pizza with odd price and number them starting from 1. Then in the (2*x?1)-th such day Cucumber Boy pays more money than Cucumber Girl, and in the (2*x)-th such day, Cucumber Girl pays more money than Cucumber Boy. That is, at such days with numbers 1, 3, 5, ... Cucumber Boy pays more money than Cucumber Girl, while at such days with numbers 2, 4, 6, ... we have the opposite situation. So now Cucumber Boys objective will be accomplished if the number of times that he pays more money than her greater than the number of times that he pays less than her. N 2*x?1 2*x 1, 3, 5, ... 2, 4, 6, ...  the number of times that he pays more money than her greater than the number of times that he pays less than her Now your task is to calculate the number of pairs of buildings for which Cucumber Boys objective will be accomplished. Input The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. T T The first line of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers N and B. The description of each B buildings follows. 2 N B B The first line for each building i contains one string, which is raw or random. If this string is raw, then N lines follow, each line contains N space-separated integers, where the k-th integer of the j-th line denotes Q[i, j, k]. If this string is random, then a single line follows containing 3 space-separated integers Si, Pi and Ai. Let the array Xi be defined as Xi[1] = Si, Xi[k] = (Pi * Xi[k?1] + Ai) modulo M, where M = 232 = 4294967296. Then Q[i, j, k] is calculated as (floor(Xi[(j?1)*N+k] / D) modulo 100) + 1, where D = 212 = 4096. i raw random raw N N k j Q[i, j, k] random 3 Si i Pi i Ai i Xi i Xi[1] = Si, Xi[k] = (Pi * Xi[k?1] + Ai) modulo M i i i i i i M = 232 = 4294967296 32 Q[i, j, k] (floor(Xi[(j?1)*N+k] / D) modulo 100) + 1 i D = 212 = 4096 12 Output For each test case, output a single line containing the number of pairs (i1, i2) of buildings with 1 ? i1 < i2 ?

Lets call the pizza of the shop x of the building 1 collaborated with the shop y of the building 2 as pizza (x, y). Then the price of the pizza (1, 1) is 82*19+51*84+44*64 = 8658, the price of the pizza (1, 2) is 82*17+51*43+44*44 = 5523, the price of the pizza (1, 3) is 82*30+51*81+44*57 = 9099, the price of the pizza (2, 1) is 41*19+10*84+38*64 = 4051, the price of the pizza (2, 2) is 41*17+10*43+38*44 = 2799, the price of the pizza (2, 3) is 41*30+10*81+38*57 = 4206, the price of the pizza (3, 1) is 23*19+33*84+58*64 = 6921, the price of the pizza (3, 2) is 23*17+33*43+58*44 = 4362, the price of the pizza (3, 3) is 23*30+33*81+58*57 = 6669. There will be 5 days for which at least one of the corresponding pizzas has odd price as follows: pizzas (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), pizzas (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3), pizzas (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), pizzas (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2), pizzas (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1). Therefore Cucumber boy will pay more money than Cucumber girl in 3 of these 5 days, and Cucumber boy will pay less in 2 of these 5 days. Note that all pizzas (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2) have even price, hence Cucumber Boy and Cucumber Girl pay the same amount of money in this day.

In case youre not, heres a short description. The game is played on a rectangular grid with R rows and C columns. Some cells contain mines and the others are empty. Initially, all cells are closed - their content is hidden. A player has to open all empty cells without opening a cell which contains a mine. You can open a cell by clicking on it. Opening an empty cells displays a number of mines in the neighbouring 8 cells. In case there arent any mines in the neighbourhood, all neighbouring cells are automatically opened. This way you can open large mine-free areas with a single click. As the name of this problem suggests, you will be dealing with a reversed process of minesweeping. A player starts with a grid where all cells are open and are either empty or contain a mine. The goal of this reversed game is to hide the mines by closing all cells as fast as possible. There are two ways to close a cell. You can either click on it or the cell can automatically close as a result of clicking on some other cell. Clicking on a cell C1 closes all cells C2 which could open simultaneously with C1 in a normal game of Minesweeper (as a result of a single click somewhere on the grid). More formally, let Sx,y be a set of all cells which are opened when you click on the cell (x,y) in a normal game of Minesweeper. Clicking on a cell C1 will also close all cells C2 such that there exists a set Sx,y which contains both C1 and C2. You can safely click on a mine cell to close it.

If the plane drops a bomb on a city A, with damage value X then the damage done to a city B will be floor(X/2d) where d is the distance between A and B, note that as the distance of A from itself is 0, the damage done to A will be floor(X/20) = X. Each city has a certain wealth Wi in it, if it is damaged by a value of X then its wealth is reduced by X. On a day if the wealth of a city becomes less than or equal to zero then it is considered Economically Dead. Your task is to write a program that keeps track of the bombings done by the plane and answer the queries asked by the chef. The chef has a total of Q queries for you. There are two types of queries.  1) Chef gives you two integers A and X, which means that the plane drops a bomb on the city with index A with damage value X. A bomb can also be dropped on economically dead city. 2) Chef gives you an integer A and you need to print the number of cities that are economically dead which have A in the path from the capital to them.

Payton likes numbers, but all the numbers he has ever known are the ordinary integers, and he doesnt like it. Thus he created his own set of “numbers”, which he called Payton numbers. Each Payton number is a triplet of ordinary integers (a,b,c), with the restriction that c is either 11 or 24 (because Payton likes 11 and 24). And then, Payton defines the product of two Payton numbers (a1,b1,c1) and (a2,b2,c2) as the following: def multiply((a1,b1,c1), (a2,b2,c2)):  s = (a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2) + (a1b2 + b1a2) + (c1 + c2) t = floor[s/2] + 16(c1 + c2) - c1c2 A = (t - 2(a1b2 + b1a2) - (a1c2 + c1a2) + 33(a1 + a2) + (b1b2 - a1a2)) B = (t - 5(a1b2 + b1a2) - (c1b2 + b1c2) + 33(b1 + b2) + (2b1b2 + 4a1a2))  if s is even: return (A-540,B-540,24) else: return (A-533,B-533,11) Eventually, Payton found out that he can define many interesting things about his numbers: A zero is a Payton number z whose product with any other Payton number is z. Payton proved that there is a unique zero in Payton numbers, namely (11,11,11). A unity is a Payton number whose product with any other Payton number is that Payton number. Payton proved that there is a unique unity in Payton numbers, namely (4,4,24). A Payton number x divides another Payton number y if there exists a Payton number z such that x·z = y. A Payton number is a unit if it divides a unity. Payton proved that any unity is also a unit, therefore (4,4,24) is a unit. But its possible that there are other units. A Payton number is prime if it isnt a zero, isnt a unit, and cant be written as the product of two nonzero, non-unit Payton numbers.

The pizza has been a craze all over Bhiwani. The secret of the softness of the pizza lies in the fact that Chef tosses them high in the air before putting them in the oven. He makes a lot of pizzas each day to fulfil the ever-increasing demand. At some point of the time, Chef got bored. Therefore, he created a game for himself. Assume that the pizza has two sides: front side denoted by F, and back side denoted by B. He owns a lucky sequence of sides; i.e., a string of length N over alphabet {F, B}. Chef will toss the pizza many times. After every toss, he will jot down the side that comes up. All tosses are independent and each side has equal probability of coming up (50%). He has made M tosses today. He will keep tossing until the string denoting last N tosses is equal to his lucky sequence.

On the table, there are two bowls ?lled with glass beads. In each move, depending on whose turn it is, you or your opponent can do one of the following. Move one bead from the ?rst bowl to the second bowl Remove one bead from the second bowl. At any point in the game, let x denote the number of beads in the ?rst bowl and y denote the number of beads in the second bowl. If x + y is even, it is your turn to move. If x + y is odd, it is your opponent’s turn to move At each position of the game, you get some points that depend on the number of beads, x and y, in the two bowls. This is given by a function f(x, y) = Ax2 + By2 + Cxy, where A, B and C are integers that are ?xed each time the game is played. The game starts with M beads in the ?rst bowl and N beads in the second bowl. As the game progresses, beads are removed. The game ends when both bowls are empty. Your score for the game is the sum of the values f(x, y) for each position (x, y) that the game passes through, starting from (M, N) and ending with (0, 0). Your aim is to obtain as high a score as possible, no matter what moves your opponent chooses. Remember that your opponent is ?endishly ingenious and will always play in such a way as to minimize your score. For example, suppose the game starts with 2 beads in each bowl and the score function is f(x, y) = x2 ? y2 ? xy: that is, A = 1, B = ?1 and C = ?1. Here are some plays of the game—the positions where you choose the move are enclosed in boxes and the positions where your opponent moves are not enclosed in boxes.

A little party never killed nobody... After listening to this song many times Leha has decided to get together with his friends and have some fun again. But things are not as simple as you might think. Leha has N friends and he already had M parties with them and for some reason all these events were not good. He guesses that sometimes guys cant get across with each other. All his friends respect him and they always have come independently of their mood. And here is the problem: there is always some subset of his friends at the party that guys from these subset become angry. Now Leha wants to analyze previous events and find some groups of his friends(maybe empty) with correspondent moods which usually lead to problems. He perfectly remembers their states during previous time. A friend could have come either with good mood(in this case we will denote it as an upper-case Latin letter) or with bad mood(in this case we will denote it as an lower-case Latin letter). The same letters(even if their cases differ) correspond to one friend and different letters correspond to different friends. Lets consider an example: Leha has 3 friends and he had 3 parties with them with states AbC(friends A and C were in good mood, but B was in bad mood), Abc(A was in good mood, others were in bad), aBC(A was in bad mood, others were in good). During all these parties something had gone wrong. We can notice that when there is subset Ab(A was in good mood, but B was in bad mood) party is spoiled and the mood of friend C doesnt matter. We also have party with state aBC which gives us problems. We cant say anything special about other subsets(for example: here all parties are spoiled with subsets A, b but we dont have enough information to assume that these subsets are always bad) So we have two subsets which if are presented guarantee us some problems: Ab and aBC. We will call them key subsets. Leha wants to find several key subsets with minimal total size that describe all problem parties.

For registering he was asked to choose a nickname and a password. There was no problem with choosing a nickname (Chef is his favorite nickname), but choosing a password in a secure way seemed to be a real problem for Chef. Therefore, he decided to write a program which would generate the password of length N consisting of small Latin letters a..z. Then Chef successfully registered at the site and saved the password in a file (as it was too hard to remember). Today Chef decided to visit the site once again. He entered his nickname, copied the password from the file... Authentication failed! was the answer. Trying to understand the reason of this, he noticed that the password in his file had length N+K instead of N! Sure enough of the source of the problem, Chef went straight to his young brother. And Chef was right, it was his brother who had inserted K random small Latin letters at some random positions (possibly at the beginning or at the end) of the password. Chefs brother didnt remember what exactly changes he had made at all, but he promised that he had done nothing besides inserting letters. As there is no other way to recover the password, Chef is now starting to remove every possible combination of K letters from the password trying to enter (when Chef obtains the same password as one of the previously entered passwords, he doesnt try to enter using this password again). Now the question is: what is the number of times Chef will receive Authentication failed! as the answer before successful entering in the worst case?

Archaeologist Benjamas is running for her life after investigating the mysterious Crocodiles Underground City. The city has N chambers. There are M bidirectional corridors, each connecting a different pair of distinct chambers. Running through different corridors may require different amounts of time. Only K of the N chambers are exit chambers that allow her to escape. Benjamas starts in chamber 0. She wants to reach an exit chamber as quickly as possible. The Crocodile gatekeeper wants to prevent Benjamas from escaping. From his den, he controls secret doors that can block any single corridor. That is, whenever he blocks a new corridor, the previously blocked one has to be reopened. Benjamass situation can be described as follows: Each time she tries to leave a chamber, the Crocodile gatekeeper may choose to block one of the corridors adjacent to it. Benjamas then chooses and follows one of the unblocked corridors to the next chamber. Once Benjamas enters a corridor, the Crocodile gatekeeper may not block it until Benjamas reaches the other end. Once she enters the next chamber, the gatekeeper may again choose to block one of the outgoing corridors (possibly the corridor that Benjamas just followed), and so on. She would like to have a simple escape plan in advance. More precisely, she would like to have a set of instructions that tell her what to do when she gets to a chamber. Let A be one of the chambers. If it is an exit chamber, no instructions are needed–obviously, she can escape the city. Otherwise, the instruction for chamber A should have one of the following forms: If you ever reach chamber A, take the corridor leading to chamber B. However, if that corridor is blocked, then take the corridor leading to chamber C. Dont bother about chamber A; according to this escape plan you cannot possibly reach it. Note that in some cases (for example, if your plan directs Benjamas to run in a cycle) the gatekeeper may be able to prevent Benjamas from reaching an exit. An escape plan is good if Benjamas is guaranteed to reach an exit chamber after a finite amount of time, regardless of what the gatekeeper does. For a good escape plan, let T be the smallest time such that after time T, Benjamas is guaranteed to reach an exit. In that case, we say that the good escape plan takes time T. Let us assume that: N – the number of chambers. The chambers are numbered 0 through N-1. M – the number of corridors. The corridors are numbered 0 through M-1. R – a two-dimensional array of integers representing the corridors. For 0 ? i < M, corridor i connects two distinct chambers R[i][0] and R[i][1]. No two corridors join the same pair of chambers. L – a one-dimensional array of integers containing the times needed to traverse the corridors. For 0 ? i < M, the value 1 ? L[i] ? 1,000,000,000 is the time Benjamas needs to runthrough the ith corridor. K – the number of exit chambers. You may assume that 1 ? K < N. P – a one-dimensional array of integers with K distinct entries describing the exit chambers. For 0 ? i < K, the value P[i] is the number of the ith exit chamber. Chamber 0 will never be one of the exit chambers.', ' admin', '9', '', 'True', 'hard', ' admin', '1', '50000'),

So we have obtained a treestring. The scientists havent decided yet how the treestring should be pronounced, but they have invented a definition of a substring for a treestring. A string is a substring of a treestring if and only it can be obtained by moving from some vertice to its descendant and writing out all the letters from vertices that occured on this path in the order they have appeared. For example, consider the following treestring :       The string ba is a substring of a given treestring because it can be obtained by moving from vertice 4 to vertice 6, the string abb is also a substring of this treestring - it can be obtained by moving from the root to vertice 5.

There is an ancient legend in China called Ranka (Content taken from wikipedia) Wang Chih was a hardy young fellow who used to venture deep into the mountains to find suitable wood for his axe. One day he went farther than usual and became lost. He wandered about for a while and eventually came upon two strange old men who were playing Go, their board resting on a rock between them. Wang Chih was fascinated. He put down his axe and began to watch. One of the players gave him something like a date to chew on, so that he felt neither hunger nor thirst. As he continued to watch he fell into a trance for what seemed like an hour or two. When he awoke, however, the two old men were no longer there. He found that his axe handle had rotted to dust and he had grown a long beard. When he returned to his native village he discovered that his family had disappeared and that no one even remembered his name. So how could that happen? Well, thats because the game Go can played very long. Lets first define the game Go: In this game, we focus on the game played on a 9x9 board. It is a game played by 2 players. A plays black stone while B plays white. They play alternatively. A goes first. In each cell there can be 3 states: empty, having 1 black stone and having 1 white stone. If we link the same color stones which are neighbourhood (|x1-x2| + |y1-y2| = 1), we can get some connected component. We say a connected component is dead if no stone in it has an empty neighbourhood cell. In each move, the player must put the stone on an empty cell or pass the turn. If this player put a stone, following situation will happen. If after this move there is at least one connected component of opponent dead, then stones from these dead components will be removed. (In this case, after remove all dead components of your opponent, we can prove all your connected component are not dead.) Otherwise, if there are at least one connected component of yours dead, then this move is invalid. In order to avoid infinite loops, there is a rule called No same state. The state of board can be expressed as a string with length 82: the first character indicate who is the next player, then 9*9 character indicate the state of a certain cell. If after one move the game goes into a state that previously occurred, then this move is invalid. You are given an integer N. Please output a match that contains N valid moves for both player.

The project itself is very simple: there are some touristic routes in Byteland, and N touristic campuses (numbered from 1 to N). For the sake of economy, there are exactly N-1 road between them. Of course, even having this given, it is possible to travel from any touristic campus to any other one. Moreover, for the sake of safety, each road is no longer than 2 kilometers. When some student wants to travel, he first chooses his starting campus - he is been delivered there (say) by a helicopter. He chooses his final destination campus as well. From his final destination, he will be transported to his home by (say) a helicopter, again. So that pupil wont travel any extra distance by foot. When the start and the finish are chosen and the pupil is delivered, he starts his moving by the only route. None of pupils is infinitely strong, so first the pupil looks at the map of the touristic routes, and then he chooses the furthest campus on his way that he can reach during the current day (by safety regulations, it is strictly prohibited to sleep not at the campus because there can be a little trouble with werewolves), and moves there. Then the new day begins, and it repeats till the moment when the destination is reached. Of course, not all the students created equal. Somebody is good in math, somebody in English, somebody in PE. So its quite natural that all high-schoolers has different strengths. We call the strength is the maximal number of kilometers that the pupil can pass in a day.

More formally, an item with price a * i + b is added to the store u + i for all (0 ? i ? v - u). In additional to the cost of the item itself, the tourist must pay some conservation fees as well. The Codeland regularly defines the new conservation fee. Each fee is represented by 4 numbers: u v a b which means the tourist buying any item in the store u + i will be charged a fee of i * a + b for all (0 ? i ? v - u). In the case that several conservation fees have effect on the same store, the customer needs to pay all of those fees. At some point of time, a tourist at store i asks you what is the largest amount of money they have to spend for a souvenir at that store (the amount of money includes the price of one of the souvenirs and all the conservation fees for that store).', ' march14 medium-hard segment-tree tuananh93', '308', 'Constraints 1 ?

Dancing Elephants is a spectacular show in Pattaya that features N elephants dancing on a line, known as the stage. After years of training, elephants in this show are capable of many amazing dances. The show consists of a series of acts. In each act, exactly one elephant performs a cute dance while possibly moving to a different position. The show producers want to produce a photo book that contains pictures of the entire show. After each act, they want to take pictures of all elephants as seen by the spectators. At any time during the show, multiple elephants may share the same position. In that case, they simply stand behind one another at the same position. A single camera can take a picture of a group of elephants if and only if all their positions lie on some segment of length L (including both its endpoints). As the elephants can spread out across the stage, multiple cameras may be needed in order to take simultaneous snapshots of all the elephants. As an example, suppose that L=10 and that the elephants are at positions 10, 15, 17, and 20 on the stage. At this moment, a single camera can take their picture, as shown below. (Elephants are shown as triangles; cameras are shown as trapezoids.)    In the following act, the elephant at position 15 dances to position 32.

We did it this way: The two bullies of our gully would appoint themselves captains of the opposing teams, and then they would take turns picking other players. On each round, a captain would choose the most capable (or, towards the end, the least inept) player from the pool of remaining candidates, until everyone present had been assigned to one side or the other. The aim of this ritual was to produce two evenly matched teams and, along the way, to remind each of us of our precise ranking in the neighbourhood pecking order. We all believed this was the fairest process, but does it ensure the fairest selection of players with evenly matched teams? We believed so, but then there were times when, as the game progressed we realized that the other team was stronger than ours and may be an exchange of a couple of players between the teams would have made them balanced. That scope of improvement seemed to be there... Here, we need to find a way to create two evenly balanced teams for any game(or as evenly balanced as possible considering the strength of each player). A set of players must be divided into two teams. Each player must be on one team or the other; the number of player on the two teams must not differ by more than 1; each player will have a skill-point associated with him. The total skill-points of the players on each team should be as nearly equal as possible.(The absolute difference of the sum of skill-points of players in each team should be the least).', ' admin', '3', '', 'True', 'hard', ' admin', '3 - 5', '50000'),

He soon discovered that his elite commandos preferred to do the fighting, and leave the thinking to their superiors. So, when at the first rollcall the soldiers lined up in fairly random order it was not because of their lack of discipline, but simply because they couldnt work out how to form a line in correct order of ranks. Sgt Johnny was not at all amused, particularly as he soon found that none of the soldiers even remembered his own rank. Over the years of service every soldier had only learned which of the other soldiers were his superiors. But Sgt Johnny was not a man to give up easily when faced with a true military challenge. After a moments thought a solution of brilliant simplicity struck him and he issued the following order: men, starting from the left, one by one, do: (step forward; go left until there is no superior to the left of you; get back in line).. This did indeed get the men sorted in a few minutes. The problem was solved... for the time being. The next day, the soldiers came in exactly the same order as the day before, and had to be rearranged using the same method. History repeated. After some weeks, Sgt Johnny managed to force each of his soldiers to remember how many men he passed when going left, and thus make the sorting process even faster. If you know how many positions each man has to walk to the left, can you try to find out what order of ranks the soldiers initially line up in?', ' admin', '6', '', 'True', 'hard', ' admin', '13', '50000'),

Chef is instructor of the famous course Introduction to Algorithms in a famous univerisity. There are n students in his class. There is not enough space in the class room, so students sit in a long hallway in a linear fashion. One day Chef was late to class. As a result, some of the students have formed pairs and are talking to each other, while the others are busy studying. This information is given to you by a string s of length n, consisting of characters *, < and >, where * denotes that the student is studying, > denotes that the corresponding student is talking to the student to the right, and < denotes that the corresponding student is talking to the student to the left. For example, consider a sample configuration of students - *><*. Here students numbered 1 and 4 are busy studying, while the student 2 and 3 are talking to each other. In this example, ><><, student 1 and 2 are talking to each other, and 3 and 4 are also talking to each other.

Same is the case for right. Similarly, >><< is also not a valid configuration, as students 2 and 3 are talking to each other, so student 1 wont be able to talk to student 2. When the students see their teacher coming, those who were talking get afraid and immediately turn around, i.e. students talking to left have now turned to the right, and the one talking to right have turned to the left. When Chef sees two students facing each other, he will assume that they were talking. A student who is busy studying will continue doing so. Chef will call each pair of students who were talking and punish them. Can you find out how many pairs of students will get punished?

The other numbers are written according to an inductive rule — after Ai-1 numbers have been written in a row, then Ai can be written at either end of the row.

For example, if D = 2 and N = 3, then sum(2, 3) equals to sum(sum(3)) = sum(1 + 2 + 3) = sum(6) = 21. Tuzik wants to calculate some values of the sum(D, N) function.
